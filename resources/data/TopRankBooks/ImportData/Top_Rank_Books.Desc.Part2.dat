9780440334521|Adored bestselling author Diana Gabaldon brings us the first book in a new trilogy featuring many of the characters from her wildly popular Outlander series.<br>In her <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Outlander novels, Diana Gabaldon introduced millions of readers to a dazzling world of history and adventure -- a world of vibrant settings and utterly unforgettable characters. Now one of these characters, Major Lord John Grey, opens the door to his own part of this world -- eighteenth-century London, a seething anthill of nobility and rabble peopled by soldiers and spies, whores and dukes. Great Britain is battling France for supremacy on three continents -- and life is good for a soldier.<br>The year is 1757. On a clear morning in mid-June, Lord John Grey emerges from London&#8217;s Beefsteak Club, his mind in turmoil. A nobleman and a high-ranking officer in His Majesty&#8217;s Army, Grey has just witnessed something shocking. But his efforts to avoid a scandal that might destroy his family are interrupted by something still more urgent: the Crown appoints him to investigate the brutal murder of a comrade in arms, who may have been a traitor.<br>Obliged to pursue two inquiries at once, Major Grey finds himself ensnared in a web of treachery and betrayal that touches every stratum of English society -- and threatens all he holds dear. From the bawdy houses of London&#8217;s night-world to the stately drawing rooms of the nobility, and from the blood of a murdered corpse to the thundering seas ruled by the majestic fleet of the East India Company, Lord John pursues the elusive trails of a vanishing footman and a woman in green velvet, who may hold the key to everything -- ornothing.<br>The early days of the Seven Years War come brilliantly to life in this historical mystery by an author whose unique and compelling storytelling has engrossed millions of readers worldwide.

9780156027328|<i>Life of Pi </i>is a masterful and utterly original novel that is at once the story of a young castaway who faces immeasurable hardships on the high seas, and a meditation on religion, faith, art and life that is as witty as it is profound. Using the threads of all of our best stories, Yann Martel has woven a glorious spiritual adventure that makes us question what it means to be alive, and to believe.<br>Growing up in Pondicherry, India, Piscine Molitor Patel -- known as Pi -- has a rich life. Bookish by nature, young Pi acquires a broad knowledge of not only the great religious texts but of all literature, and has a great curiosity about how the world works. His family runs the local zoo, and he spends many of his days among goats, hippos, swans, and bears, developing his own theories about the nature of animals and how human nature conforms to it. Pi&#8217;s family life is quite happy, even though his brother picks on him and his parents aren&#8217;t quite sure how to accept his decision to simultaneously embrace and practise three religions -- Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam.<br>But despite the lush and nurturing variety of Pi&#8217;s world, there are broad political changes afoot in India, and when Pi is sixteen his parents decide that the family needs to escape to a better life. Choosing to move to Canada, they close the zoo, pack their belongings, and board a Japanese cargo ship called the <i>Tsimtsum</i>. Travelling with them are many of their animals, bound for zoos in North America. However, they have only just begun their journey when the ship sinks, taking the dreams of the Patel family down with it. Only Pi survives, cast adrift in a lifeboat with the unlikeliest oftravelling companions: a zebra, an orang-utan, a hyena, and a 450-pound Royal Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.<br>Thus begins Pi Patel&#8217;s epic, 227-day voyage across the Pacific, and the powerful story of faith and survival at the heart of <i>Life of Pi</i>. Worn and scared, oscillating between hope and despair, Pi is witness to the playing out of the food chain, quite aware of his new position within it. When only the tiger is left of the seafaring menagerie, Pi realizes that his survival depends on his ability to assert his own will, and sets upon a grand and ordered scheme to keep from being Richard Parker&#8217;s next meal.<br>As the days pass, Pi fights both boredom and terror by throwing himself into the practical details of surviving on the open sea -- catching fish, collecting rain water, protecting himself from the sun -- all the while ensuring that the tiger is also kept alive, and knows that Pi is the key to his survival. The castaways face gruelling pain in their brushes with starvation, illness, and the storms that lash the small boat, but there is also the solace of beauty: the rainbow hues of a dorado&#8217;s death-throes, the peaceful eye of a looming whale, the shimmering blues of the ocean&#8217;s swells. Hope is fleeting, however, and despite adapting his religious practices to his daily routine, Pi feels the constant, pressing weight of despair. It is during the most hopeless and gruelling days of his voyage that Pi whittles to the core of his beliefs, casts off his own assumptions, and faces his underlying terrors head-on.<br>As Yann Martel has said in one interview, &#8220;The theme of this novel can be summarized in three lines. Life is a story. You can choose your story. And a story with an imaginative overlay is the better story.&#8221; And for Martel, the greatest imaginative overlay is religion. &#8220;God is a shorthand for anything that is beyond the material -- any greater pattern of meaning.&#8221; In <i>Life of Pi</i>, the question of stories, and of what stories to believe, is front and centre from the beginning, when the author tells us how he was led to Pi Patel and to this novel: in an Indian coffee house, a gentleman told him, &#8220;I have a story that will make you believe in God.&#8221; And as this novel comes to its brilliant conclusion, Pi shows us that the story with the imaginative overlay is also the story that contains the most truth. <P>Author Biography&#58; Yann Martel was born in Spain in 1963 of peripatetic Canadian parents. He grew up in Alaska, British Columbia, Costa Rica, France, Ontario and Mexico, and has continued travelling as an adult, spending time in Iran, Turkey and India. Martel refers to his travels as, &#8220;seeing the same play on a whole lot of different stages.&#8221;<br>After studying philosophy at Trent University and while doing various odd jobs -- tree planting, dishwashing, working as a security guard -- he began to write. In addition to <i>Life of Pi</i>, Martel is the prize-winning author of <i>The Facts Behind the Helsinki Roccamatios</i><i>,</i> a collection of short stories, and of <i>Self</i>, a novel, both published internationally. Yann has been living from his writing since the age of 27. He divides his time between yoga, writing and volunteering in a palliative care unit. Yann Martel lives in Montreal.

Painting surprising portraits of Lincoln and other presidents, including Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and Lyndon B. Johnson, and illuminating the courage of such influential citizen activists as Martin Luther King, Jr., early suffragettes Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt, civil rights pioneers Rosa Parks and John Lewis, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Army-McCarthy hearings lawyer Joseph N. Welch, Meacham brings vividly to life turning points in American history. He writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the birth of the Lost Cause; the backlash against immigrants in the First World War and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s; the fight for women&rsquo;s rights; the demagoguery of Huey Long and Father Coughlin and the isolationist work of America First in the years before World War II; the anti-Communist witch-hunts led by Senator Joseph McCarthy; and Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s crusade against Jim Crow.

This is must-read material if you want to understand what the Trump administration is still up to right now." &#151;Lawrence O'Donnell</b><br><br>There are questions that the Mueller report couldn't&mdash;or wouldn't&mdash;answer. What actually happened to instigate the Russia investigation? Did President Trump&rsquo;s meddling incriminate him? There&rsquo;s no mystery to what Trump thinks. He claims that the Deep State, a cabal of career bureaucrats&mdash;among them, Andrew McCabe, Lisa Page, and Peter Strzok, previously little known figures within the FBI whom he has obsessively and publically reviled&mdash;is concerned only with protecting its own power and undermining the democratic process. Conversely, James Comey has defended the FBI as incorruptible apolitical public servants who work tirelessly to uphold the rule of law. <br> &#160;<br> For the first time, bestselling author James B. Stewart sifts these conflicting accounts to present a clear-eyed view of what exactly happened inside the FBI in the lead-up to the 2016 election, drawing on scores of interviews with key FBI, Department of Justice, and White House officialsand voluminous transcripts, notes, and internal reports. In full detail, this is the dramatic saga of the FBI&rsquo;s simultaneous investigations of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump&mdash;the first time in American history the FBI has been thrust into the middle of both parties' campaigns for the presidency. Stewart shows what exactly was set in motion when Trump fired Comey, triggering the appointment of Robert Mueller as an independent special counsel and causing the FBI to open a formal investigation into the president himself. And how this unprecedented event joined in ongoing combat two vital institutions of American democracy&#58; the presidency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.&#160;<br> &#160;<br> At stake in this epic battle is the rule of law itself, the foundation of the U.S. Constitution. There is no room for compromise, but plenty for collateral damage. The reputations of both sides have already been harmed, perhaps irrevocably, and at great cost to American democracy. <i>Deep State</i> goes beyond the limits of the legally constrained Mueller report, showing how the president&rsquo;s obsession with the idea of a conspiracy against him is still upending lives and sending shockwaves through both the FBI and the Department of Justice. In this world-historical struggle&mdash;Trump versus intelligence agencies&mdash;Stewart shows us in rare style what&rsquo;s real and what matters now. And for the looming 2020 election.

John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Dahmer. The names of notorious serial killers are usually well-known; they echo in the news and in public consciousness. But most people have never heard of Israel Keyes, one of the most ambitious and terrifying serial killers in modern history. The FBI considered his behavior unprecedented. Described by a prosecutor as "a force of pure evil," Keyes was a predator who struck all over the United States. He buried "kill kits"&#151;cash, weapons, and body-disposal tools&#151;in remote locations across the country. Over the course of fourteen years, Keyes would fly to a city, rent a car, and drive thousands of miles in order to use his kits. He would break into a stranger's house, abduct his victims in broad daylight, and kill and dispose of them in mere hours. And then he would return home to Alaska, resuming life as a quiet, reliable construction worker devoted to his only daughter.<br><br>When journalist Maureen Callahan first heard about Israel Keyes in 2012, she was captivated by how a killer of this magnitude could go undetected by law enforcement for over a decade. And so began a project that consumed her for the next several years&#151;uncovering the true story behind how the FBI ultimately caught Israel Keyes, and trying to understand what it means for a killer like Keyes to exist. A killer who left a path of monstrous, randomly committed crimes in his wake&#151;many of which remain unsolved to this day.<br><br><i>American Predator </i>is the ambitious culmination of years of interviews with key figures in law enforcement and in Keyes's life, and research uncovered from classified FBI files. Callahan takes us on a journey into the chilling, nightmarish mind of a relentless killer, and to the limitations of traditional law enforcement.

Fairweather has dug up a story of incalculable value and delivered it to us in the most compelling prose I have read in a long time.&#8221; &#8212;Sebastian Junger, bestselling author of <em>The Perfect Storm</em> and <em>Tribe</em></strong></p><p>The incredible true story of a Polish resistance fighter&#8217;s infiltration of Auschwitz to sabotage the camp from within, and his death-defying attempt to warn the Allies about the Nazis&#8217; plans for a &#8220;Final Solution&#8221; before it was too late.</p><p>To uncover the fate of the thousands being interred at a mysterious Nazi camp on the border of the Reich, a thirty-nine-year-old Polish resistance fighter named Witold Pilecki volunteered for an audacious mission&#58; assume a fake identity, intentionally get captured and sent to the new camp, and then report back to the underground on what had happened to his compatriots there. But gathering information was not his only task&#58; he was to execute an attack from inside&#8212;where the Germans would least expect it.&#160;</p><p>The name of the camp was Auschwitz.</p><p>Over the next two and half years, Pilecki forged an underground army within Auschwitz that sabotaged facilities, assassinated Nazi informants and officers, and gathered evidence of terrifying abuse and mass murder. But as he pieced together the horrifying truth that the camp was to become the epicenter of Nazi plans to exterminate Europe&#8217;s Jews, Pilecki realized he would have to risk his men, his life, and his family to warn the West before all was lost. To do so, meant attempting the impossible&#8212;an escape from Auschwitz itself.</p><p>Completely erased from the historical record by Poland&#8217;s post-war Communist government, Pilecki remains almost unknown to the world. Now, with exclusive access to previously hidden diaries, family and camp survivor accounts, and recently declassified files, Jack Fairweather offers an unflinching portrayal of survival, revenge and betrayal in mankind&#8217;s darkest hour. And in uncovering the tragic outcome of Pilecki&#8217;s mission, he reveals that its ultimate defeat originated not in Auschwitz or Berlin, but in London and Washington.</p>

I came across his photo in a Jet magazine that marked the anniversary of his death. At the time, I was convinced he wasn&rsquo;t real, or at least that he wasn&rsquo;t a person. What was supposed to be a face was mutilated beyond recognition. He looked more like a prop from a movie to me; a monster from some over-the-top horror flick.<br>But he was a person, a boy, and his story was a cautionary tale, even for a black girl in Mississippi who was born more than three decades after he died. &ldquo;Know your worth,&rdquo; my mom would say, &ldquo;but also know that not everyone values you as much as I do.&rdquo;<br>Still, Emmett wasn&rsquo;t real to me. There was no way I&rsquo;d ever have to worry about anything like that happening to me or to someone I knew. Things had changed, even in Mississippi. That was history. The present had its own problems<br>I grew up in a neighborhood that&rsquo;s notorious for all the wrong reasons. Drug dealers, shootings, crime, insert other &ldquo;ghetto&rdquo; stereotypes here. While everything they showed on the news was true, there was so much more that you wouldn&rsquo;t see unless you lived there.  It was my home. My neighbors were family. The neighborhood drug dealer was a superhero who gave kids money for snacks and beat up pedophiles who tried to snatch little girls off the street. The cops could be superheroes too, but I was taught at a young age to be &ldquo;mindful&rdquo; around them. So had my friends. We&rsquo;d all heard stories, and though they didn&rsquo;t come with mutilated photos, they were realer than Emmett. <br><br>I remember the first time I saw the video of Oscar Grant.<br>I was a transfer student in my first year at the college I&rsquo;d later graduate from. It was in a nicer part of town than where I lived, but only ten minutes away from it, and it was very, very white. A majority of the time, I was the only black student in my creative writing classes. I did everything I could so no one would label me as the &ldquo;black girl from the hood.&rdquo; I would leave home, blasting Tupac, but by the time I arrived to pick up a friend, I was listening to the Jonas Brothers. I kept quiet whenever race came up in discussions, despite the glances I&rsquo;d get because as the &ldquo;token black girl,&rdquo; I was expected to speak. <br>But Oscar did something to me. Suddenly, Emmett wasn&rsquo;t history. Emmett was still reality.  <br>The video was shocking for multiple reasons, one being that someone actually caught it on tape. This was undeniable evidence that had never been provided for the stories I&rsquo;d heard. Yet my classmates, who had never heard such tales, had their own opinions about it.<br>&ldquo;He should&rsquo;ve just done what they said.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He was resisting.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I heard he was an ex-con and a drug dealer.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He had it coming. Why are people so mad?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They were just doing their job.&rdquo;<br>And I hate to admit it, but I still remained silent.<br>I was hurt, no doubt. And angry. Frustrated. Straight-up pissed. I knew plenty of Oscars. I grew up with them and I was friends with them. This was like being told that they deserved to die. <br>As the unrest took place in Oakland, I wondered how my community would react if that happened to one of our Oscars. I also wondered if my classmates would make the same comments if I became an Oscar. I wasn&rsquo;t an ex-con or a drug dealer, but I was from a neighborhood they were afraid to visit, the same neighborhood they once jokingly said was full of criminals, not knowing that&rsquo;s where I lived until months later. <br>From all of those questions and emotions, <i>The Hate U Give</i> was born.<br>I&rsquo;ve always told stories. When I can&rsquo;t find a way to say the words out loud, I create characters who do it for me. <i>The Hate U Give</i> started as a short story my senior year. It was cathartic at the time, and I thought I was done telling Starr and Khalil&rsquo;s story because I foolishly hoped Oscar wouldn&rsquo;t happen again.<br>But then there was Trayvon. Michael. Eric. Tamir.<br>And there was more anger, frustration, and hurt for me, my peers, and the kids in my neighborhood who saw themselves in those gentlemen. So I expressed those feelings the best way I knew how, through story, in hopes that I would give a voice to every kid who feels the same way I do and is not sure how to express it. <br>But my ultimate hope is that everyone who reads this book, no matter their experiences, walks away from it understanding those feelings and sharing them in some way.<br>And maybe then, Emmett Louis Till can truly become history. <br>

9780062857903|<p><strong>Now a #1 New York Times Bestseller.</strong></p><p><strong>Human beings have never had it better than we have it now in the West. So why are we on the verge of throwing it all away?</strong></p><p>In 2016, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Ben Shapiro spoke at the University of California&#8211;Berkeley. Hundreds of police officers were required to protect his speech. What was so frightening about Shapiro? He came to argue that Western civilization is in the midst of a crisis of purpose and ideas; that we have let grievances replace our sense of community and political expediency limit our individual rights; that we are teaching our kids that their emotions matter more than rational debate; and that the only meaning in life is arbitrary and subjective.</p><p>As a society, we are forgetting that almost everything great that has ever happened in history happened because of people who believed in both Judeo-Christian values and in the Greek-born power of reason. In <em>The Right Side of History</em>, Shapiro sprints through more than 3,500 years, dozens of philosophers, and the thicket of modern politics to show how our freedoms are built upon the twin notions that every human being is made in God&#8217;s image and that human beings were created with reason capable of exploring God&#8217;s world.</p><p>We can thank these values for the birth of science, the dream of progress, human rights, prosperity, peace, and artistic beauty. Jerusalem and Athens built America, ended slavery, defeated the Nazis and the Communists, lifted billions from poverty, and gave billions more&#160;spiritual purpose. Jerusalem and Athens built America, ended slavery, defeated the Nazis and the Communists, lifted billions from poverty, and gave billions more spiritual purpose. </p><p>Yet we are in the process of abandoning Judeo-Christian values and Greek natural law, watching our civilization collapse into age-old tribalism, individualistic hedonism, and moral subjectivism. We believe we can satisfy ourselves with intersectionality, scientific materialism, progressive politics, authoritarian governance, or nationalistic solidarity.</p><p>We can&#8217;t.</p><p>The West is special, and in <em>The Right Side of History</em>, Ben Shapiro bravely explains how we have lost sight of the moral purpose that drives each of us to be better, the sacred duty to work together for the greater good,.</p>

9780525536222|<P><b>#1&#160;<i>New York Times</i>&#160;Bestseller<br><br>Legendary venture capitalist John Doerr reveals how the goal-setting system of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) has helped tech giants from Intel to Google achieve explosive growth&mdash;and how it can help any organization thrive. </b><br><br>In the fall of 1999, John Doerr met with the founders of a start-up whom he'd just given $12.5 million, the biggest investment of his career. Larry Page and Sergey Brin had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy, and sky-high ambitions, but no real business plan. For Google to change the world (or even to survive), Page and Brin had to learn how to make tough choices on priorities while keeping their team on track. They'd have to know when to pull the plug on losing propositions, to fail fast. And they needed timely, relevant data to track their progress&mdash;to measure what mattered.<br><br>Doerr taught them about a proven approach to operating excellence&#58; Objectives and Key Results. He had first discovered OKRs in the 1970s as an engineer at Intel, where the legendary Andy Grove ("the greatest manager of his or any era") drove the best-run company Doerr had ever seen. Later, as a venture capitalist, Doerr shared Grove's brainchild with more than fifty companies. Wherever the process was faithfully practiced, it worked.<br><br>In this goal-setting system, objectives define what we seek to achieve; key results are how those top-priority goals will be attained with specific, measurable actions within a set time frame. Everyone's goals, from entry level to CEO, are transparent to the entire organization. <br><br>The benefits are profound. OKRs surface an organization's most important work. They focus effort and foster coordination. They keep employees on track. They link objectives across silos to unify and strengthen the entire company. Along the way, OKRs enhance workplace satisfaction and boost retention.<br><br>In <i>Measure What Matters</i>, Doerr shares a broad range of first-person, behind-the-scenes case studies, with narrators including Bono and Bill Gates, to demonstrate the focus, agility, and explosive growth that OKRs have spurred at so many great organizations. This book will help a new generation of leaders capture the same magic.

Gates</strong></p><p>An extraordinary journey behind the scenes of Arlington National Cemetery, Senator Tom Cotton&#8217;s <em>Sacred Duty</em> offers an intimate and inspiring portrait of &#8220;The Old Guard,&#8221; the revered U.S. Army unit whose mission is to honor our country&#8217;s fallen heroes on the most hallowed ground in America. </p><p>Cotton was a platoon leader with the storied 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment&#8212;The Old Guard&#8212;between combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. At the height of the Iraq Surge, he carried the flag-draped remains of his fallen comrades off of airplanes at Dover Air Force Base, and he laid them to rest in Arlington&#8217;s famed Section 60, &#8220;the saddest acre in America.&#8221;&#160; He also performed hundreds of funerals for veterans of the Greatest Generation, as well as the Korean and Vietnam Wars.</p><p>The Old Guard has embodied the ideals of honor and sacrifice across our nation&#8217;s history. America&#8217;s oldest active-duty regiment, dating back to 1784, The Old Guard conducts daily military-honor funerals on the 624 rolling acres of Arlington, where generations of American heroes rest. Its soldiers hold themselves to the standard of perfection in sweltering heat, frigid cold, and driving rain. Every funeral is a no-fail, zero-defect mission, whether honoring a legendary general or a humble private.</p><p>In researching and writing the book, Cotton returned to Arlington and shadowed the regiment&#8217;s soldiers, from daily funerals to the state funeral of President George H. W. Bush to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, reliving the honor&#8212;and the challenges&#8212;of duty at the nation&#8217;s &#8220;most sacred shrine.&#8221;</p><p>Part history of The Old Guard, part memoir of Cotton&#8217;s time at Arlington, part intimate profile of the today&#8217;s soldiers, <em>Sacred Duty </em>is an unforgettable testament to the timeless power of service and sacrifice to our nation.</p>

I defy you to start it and find a way to put it down; as long as it is, I wished it were longer. . . . This is an amazing work of popular fiction.&#8221;<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8212;&#160;Stephen King</b><P><b>&#8220;One of the longest, most successful sustained works of popular fiction in recent memory&#8230; Prepare to be surprised. Iles has always been an exceptional storyteller, and he has invested these volumes with an energy and sense of personal urgency that rarely, if ever, falter.&#8221;</b><P><b>&#8212;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Washington Post</i></b><P>The endgame is at hand for Penn Cage, his family, and the enemies bent on destroying them in this revelatory volume in the epic trilogy set in modern-day Natchez, Mississippi&#8212;Greg Iles&#8217;s epic tale of love and honor, hatred and revenge that explores how the sins of the past continue to haunt the present.<P>Shattered by grief and dreaming of vengeance, Penn Cage sees his family and his world collapsing around him. The woman he loves is gone, his principles have been irrevocably compromised, and his father, once a paragon of the community that Penn leads as mayor, is about to be tried for the murder of a former lover. Most terrifying of all, Dr. Cage seems bent on self-destruction. Despite Penn's experience as a prosecutor in major murder trials, his father has frozen him out of the trial preparations&#151;preferring to risk dying in prison to revealing the truth of the crime to his son. <P>During forty years practicing medicine, Tom Cage made himself the most respected and beloved physician in Natchez, Mississippi. But this revered Southern figure has secrets known only to himself and a handful of others.&#160; Among them, Tom has a second son, the product of an 1960s affair with his devoted African American nurse, Viola Turner.&#160; It is Viola who has been murdered, and her bitter son&#151;Penn's half-brother&#151;who sets in motion the murder case against his father.&#160; The resulting investigation exhumes dangerous ghosts from Mississippi's violent past. In some way that Penn cannot fathom, Viola Turner was a nexus point between his father and the Double Eagles, a savage splinter cell of the KKK. More troubling still, the long-buried secrets shared by Dr. Cage and the former Klansmen may hold the key to the most devastating assassinations of the 1960s. The surviving Double Eagles will stop at nothing to keep their past crimes buried, and with the help of some of the most influential men in the state, they seek to ensure that Dr. Cage either takes the fall for them, or takes his secrets to an early grave.&#160; <P>Unable to trust anyone around him&#151;not even his own mother&#151;Penn joins forces with Serenity Butler, a famous young black author who has come to Natchez to write about his father's case. Together, Penn and Serenity battle to crack the Double Eagles and discover the secret history of the Cage family and the South itself, a desperate move that risks the only thing they have left to gamble&#58; their lives. <P><i>Mississippi Blood</i> is the enthralling conclusion to a breathtaking trilogy seven years in the making&#151;one that has kept readers on the edge of their seats. With piercing insight, narrative prowess, and a masterful ability to blend history and imagination, Greg Iles illuminates the brutal history of the American South in a highly atmospheric and suspenseful novel that delivers the shocking resolution his fans have eagerly awaited.&#160;<P><P>

With the birth of radio in the 1920s, the songs moved from small towns, mountain hollers, and the wide-open West to become the music of an entire nation&#151;a diverse range of sounds and styles from honky tonk to gospel to bluegrass to rockabilly, leading up through the decades to the music's massive commercial success today.<br><br>But above all, <i>Country Music</i> is the story of the musicians.

How does one do this? By becoming metahuman. <br><br> To be metahuman, however, isn&rsquo;t science fiction and is certainly not about being a superhero. To be metahuman means to move past the limitation constructed by the mind and enter a new state of awareness where we have deliberate and concrete access to peak experiences that can transform people&rsquo;s lives from the inside out. <br><br>Humans do this naturally&mdash;to a point. For centuries the great artists, scientists, writers, and many so-called ordinary people have gone beyond the everyday physical world. But if we could channel these often bewildering experiences, what would happen? Chopra argues we would wake up to experiences that would blow open your body, mind, and soul. <br><br> <i>Metahuman</i>&#160;invites the reader to walk the path here and now. Waking up, we learn, isn&rsquo;t just about mindfulness or meditation. Waking up, to become metahuman, is to expand our consciousness in all that we think, say, and do.&#160;<br><br>By going beyond, we liberate ourselves from old conditioning and all the mental constructs that underlie anxiety, tension, and ego-driven demands. Waking up allows life to make sense as never before. To make this as practical as possible, Chopra ends the book with a 31-day guide to becoming metahuman. Once you wake up, he writes, life becomes transformed, because pure consciousness&mdash;which is the field of all possibilities&mdash;dawns in your life. Only then does your infinite potential become your personal reality.<br><br><b>Advance praise for </b><i><b>Metahuman</b></i><br><br>&ldquo;Our world is preoccupied with material progress, yet too often we overlook the miracle of our very existence. In this remarkable book, Deepak Chopra reminds us not to be distracted by the idols of our age but to marvel at the deep truths of being.&#160;<i>Metahuman</i>&#160;is a handbook to becoming fully alive.&rdquo;<b>&mdash;Arthur C.

With every chapter, you get a history lesson, a hunting lesson, a nature lesson and a cooking lesson. . . . <i>Meat Eater </i>offers an overabundance to savor.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br></b> &#160;<br>Steven Rinella grew up in Twin Lake, Michigan, the son of a hunter who taught his three sons to love the natural world the way he did. As a child, Rinella devoured stories of the American wilderness, especially the exploits of his hero, Daniel Boone. He began fishing at the age of three and shot his first squirrel at eight and his first deer at thirteen. He chose the colleges he went to by their proximity to good hunting ground, and he experimented with living solely off wild meat. As an adult, he feeds his family from the food he hunts.<br> &#160;<br> <i>Meat Eater </i>chronicles Rinella&rsquo;s lifelong relationship with nature and hunting through the lens of ten hunts, beginning when he was an aspiring mountain man at age ten and ending as a thirty-seven-year-old Brooklyn father who hunts in the remotest corners of North America. He tells of having a struggling career as a fur trapper just as fur prices were falling; of a dalliance with catch-and-release steelhead fishing; of canoeing in the Missouri Breaks in search of mule deer just as the Missouri River was freezing up one November; and of hunting the elusive Dall sheep in the glaciated mountains of Alaska. <br> &#160;<br> Through each story, Rinella grapples with themes such as the role of the hunter in shaping America, the vanishing frontier, the ethics of killing, the allure of hunting trophies, the responsibilities that human predators have to their prey, and the disappearance of the hunter himself as Americans lose their connection with the way their food finds its way to their tables. Hunting, he argues, is intimately connected with our humanity; assuming responsibility for acquiring the meat that we eat, rather than entrusting it to proxy executioners, processors, packagers, and distributors, is one of the most respectful and exhilarating things a meat eater can do.<br> &#160;<br> A thrilling storyteller with boundless interesting facts and historical information about the land, the natural world, and the history of hunting, Rinella also includes after each chapter a section of &ldquo;Tasting Notes&rdquo; that draws from his thirty-plus years of eating and cooking wild game, both at home and over a campfire. In <i>Meat Eater</i> he paints a loving portrait of a way of life that is part of who we are as humans and as Americans.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Meat Eater</i></b><br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Full of empathy and intelligence . . . In some sections of the book, the author&rsquo;s prose is so engrossing, so riveting, that it matches, punch for punch, the best sports writing.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Steven Rinella is one of the best nature writers of the last decade. . . .

9780345519788|<P>Nearly five hundred years after her violent death, Anne Boleyn, second wife to Henry VIII, remains one of the world's most fascinating, controversial, and tragic heroines. Now acclaimed historian and bestselling author Alison Weir has drawn on myriad sources from the Tudor era to give us the first book that examines, in unprecedented depth, the gripping, dark, and chilling story of Anne Boleyn's final days.<br><br>The tempestuous love affair between Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn scandalized Christendom and altered forever the religious landscape of England. Anne's ascent from private gentlewoman to queen was astonishing, but equally compelling was her shockingly swift downfall. Charged with high treason and imprisoned in the Tower of London in May 1536, Anne met her terrible end all the while protesting her innocence. There remains, however, much mystery surrounding the queen's arrest and the events leading up to it&#58; Were charges against her fabricated because she stood in the way of Henry VIII making a third marriage and siring an heir, or was she the victim of a more complex plot fueled by court politics and deadly rivalry?<br><br>&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>The Lady in the Tower </b>examines in engrossing detail the motives and intrigues of those who helped to seal the queen's fate. Weir unravels the tragic tale of Anne's fall, from her miscarriage of the son who would have saved her to the horrors of her incarceration and that final, dramatic scene on the scaffold. What emerges is an extraordinary portrayal of a woman of great courage whose enemies were bent on utterly destroying her, and who was tested to the extreme by the terrible plight in which she found herself.&#160;<br><br>&#160;&#160;&#160; Richly researched and utterly captivating, <b>The Lady in the Tower</b> presents the full array of evidence of Anne Boleyn's guilt&mdash;or innocence. Only in Alison Weir's capable hands can readers learn the truth about the fate of one of the most influential and important women in English history.<br><br>BONUS&#58; This edition contains a&#160;<i>The Lady in the Tower&#160;</i>discussion guide and an excerpt from Alison Weir's&#160;<i>Mary Boleyn.</i>

Yet today, science and its practitioners have come under political attack. In this fascinating history spanning continents and centuries, historian David Wootton offers a lively defense of science, revealing why the Scientific Revolution was truly the greatest event in our history.</p><P><i>The Invention of Science</i> goes back five hundred years in time to chronicle this crucial transformation, exploring the factors that led to its birth and the people who made it happen. Wootton argues that the Scientific Revolution was actually five separate yet concurrent events that developed independently, but came to intersect and create a new worldview. Here are the brilliant iconoclasts&#8212;Galileo, Copernicus, Brahe, Newton, and many more curious minds from across Europe&#8212;whose studies of the natural world challenged centuries of religious orthodoxy and ingrained superstition.</p><P>From gunpowder technology, the discovery of the new world, movable type printing, perspective painting, and the telescope to the practice of conducting experiments, the laws of nature, and the concept of the fact, Wotton shows how these discoveries codified into a social construct and a system of knowledge. Ultimately, he makes clear the link between scientific discovery and the rise of industrialization&#8212;and the birth of the modern world we know.</p>

Levi's disappearance has links to Darren's last case, and to a wealthy businesswoman, the boy's grandmother, who seems more concerned about the fate of her business than that of her grandson. <br><br>Darren has to battle centuries-old suspicions and prejudices, as well as threats that have been reignited in the current political climate, as he races to find the boy, and to save himself.<br><br><strong>"Locke's work is political in the most impactful, necessary sense, as she tells stories of crimes both personal and systemic, all while showing a complete mastery of suspense, plotting, and style." --<em>CrimeReads</em></strong>

This is the life of M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e, the heaviest drinking, hardest fighting, most oversexed and arrogant band in the world. Their unbelievable exploits are the stuff of rock 'n' roll legend. They nailed the hottest chicks, started the bloodiest fights, partied with the biggest drug dealers, and got to know the inside of every jail cell from California to Japan. They have dedicated an entire career to living life to its extreme, from the greatest fantasies to the darkest tragedies.

It cuts right to the heart of life...If you miss <I>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</I> you will deny yourself a rich experience...It is a poignant and deeply understanding story of childhood and family relationships. The Nolans lived in the Williamsburg slums of Brooklyn from 1902 until 1919...Their daughter Francie and their son Neely knew more than their fair share of the privations and sufferings that are the lot of a great city's poor. Primarily this is Francie's book. She is a superb feat of characterization, an imaginative, alert, resourceful child. And Francie's growing up and beginnings of wisdom are the substance of <I>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</I>." <BR>&#151;<I>New York Times</I> <P> "One of the most dearly beloved and one of the finest books of our day." <BR>&#151;Orville Prescott <P>"One of the books of the century."<BR>&#151;New York Public Library<P>Author Biography&#58; <I>Betty Smith was born Elisabeth Wehner on December 15, 1896, the same</I> date as, although five years earlier than, her fictional heroine Francie Nolan. The daughter of German immigrants, she grew up poor in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, the very world she re-creates with such meticulous detail in <I>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.</I>After marrying fellow Brooklynite George H.E. Smith, she moved with him to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he was a law student at the University of Michigan. The young bride soon had two daughters, Nancy and Mary, and was forced to wait until the girls had entered grade school before endeavoring to complete her own formal education.Although she had not finished high school, the largely autodidactic Smith was permitted to take classes at the university, and she concentrated her studies there in journalism, drama, writing and literature. She capped her education by winning the Avery Hopkins Award for work in drama, and did a three-year course in playwriting at the Yale Drama School.After stints writing features for a Detroit newspaper, reading plays for the Federal Theatre Project, and acting in summer stock, Smith landed in Chapel Hill, North Carolina under the auspices of the W.P.A. She and her first husband divorced in 1938. In 1943, she married JoeJones, a writer, journalist, and associate editor of the <I>Chapel Hill Weekly,</I> while he was serving as a private in the wartime army. That same year, <I>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,</I> her first novel, was published.The prestige of writing a best-selling, critically lauded book brought assignments from the <I>New York Times Magazine,</I> for which she wrote both light-hearted and serious commentary. In a December 1943 piece called "Why Brooklyn is that Way," Smith donned the mantle of her childhood borough's unofficial champion. Her perceptions at once encapsulate one of the core themes of her novel and answer some of her more urbane critics. "Brooklyn is the small town &#151; but on a gigantic scale &#151; that the New Yorker ran away from," she wrote. "In jeering at Brooklyn's mores and ideology, your New Yorker may be trying to exorcise his own small-town background."Although most remembered for the phenomenal success of that first book, Smith wrote other novels, including <I>Tomorrow Will Be Better</I> (1947), <I>Maggie-Now</I> (1958), and <I>Joy in the Morning</I> (1963). She also had a long career as a dramatist, writing one-act and full-length plays for which she received both the Rockefeller Fellowship and the Dramatists Guild Fellowship. She died in 1972.
