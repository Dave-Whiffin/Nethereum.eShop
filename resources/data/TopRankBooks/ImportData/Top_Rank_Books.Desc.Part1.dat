It could also endanger her life.<P><B>A Note from the Author:</B><P>The story behind <i>The Hate U Give</i> by Angie Thomas<br><br>I remember the first time I saw Emmett Louis Till.<br>I couldn&rsquo;t have been more than eight years old. I came across his photo in a Jet magazine that marked the anniversary of his death. At the time, I was convinced he wasn&rsquo;t real, or at least that he wasn&rsquo;t a person. What was supposed to be a face was mutilated beyond recognition. He looked more like a prop from a movie to me; a monster from some over-the-top horror flick.<br>But he was a person, a boy, and his story was a cautionary tale, even for a black girl in Mississippi who was born more than three decades after he died. &ldquo;Know your worth,&rdquo; my mom would say, &ldquo;but also know that not everyone values you as much as I do.&rdquo;<br>Still, Emmett wasn&rsquo;t real to me. There was no way I&rsquo;d ever have to worry about anything like that happening to me or to someone I knew. Things had changed, even in Mississippi. That was history. The present had its own problems<br>I grew up in a neighborhood that&rsquo;s notorious for all the wrong reasons. Drug dealers, shootings, crime, insert other &ldquo;ghetto&rdquo; stereotypes here. While everything they showed on the news was true, there was so much more that you wouldn&rsquo;t see unless you lived there.  It was my home. My neighbors were family. The neighborhood drug dealer was a superhero who gave kids money for snacks and beat up pedophiles who tried to snatch little girls off the street. The cops could be superheroes too, but I was taught at a young age to be &ldquo;mindful&rdquo; around them. So had my friends. We&rsquo;d all heard stories, and though they didn&rsquo;t come with mutilated photos, they were realer than Emmett. <br><br>I remember the first time I saw the video of Oscar Grant.<br>I was a transfer student in my first year at the college I&rsquo;d later graduate from. It was in a nicer part of town than where I lived, but only ten minutes away from it, and it was very, very white. A majority of the time, I was the only black student in my creative writing classes. I did everything I could so no one would label me as the &ldquo;black girl from the hood.&rdquo; I would leave home, blasting Tupac, but by the time I arrived to pick up a friend, I was listening to the Jonas Brothers. I kept quiet whenever race came up in discussions, despite the glances I&rsquo;d get because as the &ldquo;token black girl,&rdquo; I was expected to speak. <br>But Oscar did something to me. Suddenly, Emmett wasn&rsquo;t history. Emmett was still reality.  <br>The video was shocking for multiple reasons, one being that someone actually caught it on tape. This was undeniable evidence that had never been provided for the stories I&rsquo;d heard. Yet my classmates, who had never heard such tales, had their own opinions about it.<br>&ldquo;He should&rsquo;ve just done what they said.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He was resisting.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I heard he was an ex-con and a drug dealer.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He had it coming. Why are people so mad?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They were just doing their job.&rdquo;<br>And I hate to admit it, but I still remained silent.<br>I was hurt, no doubt. And angry. Frustrated. Straight-up pissed. I knew plenty of Oscars. I grew up with them and I was friends with them. This was like being told that they deserved to die. <br>As the unrest took place in Oakland, I wondered how my community would react if that happened to one of our Oscars. I also wondered if my classmates would make the same comments if I became an Oscar. I wasn&rsquo;t an ex-con or a drug dealer, but I was from a neighborhood they were afraid to visit, the same neighborhood they once jokingly said was full of criminals, not knowing that&rsquo;s where I lived until months later. <br>From all of those questions and emotions, <i>The Hate U Give</i> was born.<br>I&rsquo;ve always told stories. When I can&rsquo;t find a way to say the words out loud, I create characters who do it for me. <i>The Hate U Give</i> started as a short story my senior year. It was cathartic at the time, and I thought I was done telling Starr and Khalil&rsquo;s story because I foolishly hoped Oscar wouldn&rsquo;t happen again.<br>But then there was Trayvon. Michael. Eric. Tamir.<br>And there was more anger, frustration, and hurt for me, my peers, and the kids in my neighborhood who saw themselves in those gentlemen. So I expressed those feelings the best way I knew how, through story, in hopes that I would give a voice to every kid who feels the same way I do and is not sure how to express it. <br>But my ultimate hope is that everyone who reads this book, no matter their experiences, walks away from it understanding those feelings and sharing them in some way.<br>And maybe then, Emmett Louis Till can truly become history. <br>
9780062457714|<p><strong>#1 <em>New York Times</em> Bestseller</strong></p><p><strong>Over&#160;5 million copies sold</strong></p><p>In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be "positive" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.</p><p>For decades, we&#8217;ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let&#8217;s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Mason doesn&#8217;t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is&#8212;a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is his antidote to the coddling, let&#8217;s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. </p><p>Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited&#8212;"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. </p><p>There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.</p>

The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . .</p><P>Rin&#8217;s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late.</p>

Woven through Macfarlane&rsquo;s own travels are the unforgettable stories of descents into the underland made across history by explorers, artists, cavers, divers, mourners, dreamers, and murderers, all of whom have been drawn for different reasons to seek what Cormac McCarthy calls &ldquo;the awful darkness within the world.&rdquo;</p><P>Global in its geography and written with great lyricism and power, <i>Underland</i> speaks powerfully to our present moment.

A familiar voice cut through the wind and rumble of the ship&#8217;s engines. &#8220;Ray!&#8221; called his brother, Bill. Ray, head of a medical team for the First Division&#8217;s famed 16th Infantry Regiment, had already won a silver star in 1943 for running through German lines to rescue trapped men, one of countless rescues he&#8217;d made in North Africa and Sicily. </p><P>&#8220;This is going to be the worst yet,&#8221; Ray told his brother, who served alongside him throughout the war.</p><P>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t make it,&#8221; said Bill, &#8220;take care of my family.&#8221;</p><P>&#8220;I will,&#8221; said Ray.

He would wake on the deck of a landing ship to find his battered brother clinging to life next to him.</p><P><i>Every Man a Hero</i> is the unforgettable story not only of what happened in the incredible and desperate hours on Omaha Beach, but of the bravery and courage that preceded them, throughout the Second World War&#8212;from the sands of Africa, through the treacherous mountain passes of Sicily, and beyond to the greatest military victory the world has ever known.</p><P>&#160;</p>

Washington insiders broke rule after rule investigating the president, chasing a conspiracy that turned out not to exist. Somehow this was spun into Donald Trump having something to hide. People associated with the president were pushed into plea deals that had nothing to do with Russian &ldquo;collusion&rdquo; or discouraged from serving by the threat of huge legal bills. Somehow this was spun into Trump&rsquo;s lawyers being bullies. The president complained that the investigation was a waste of time, but he allowed it to continue unimpeded to the end. Somehow this was spun into obstruction of justice.</br> </br> In <em>Witch Hun</em><em>t</em>,&#160;Gregg Jarrett uncovers the bureaucratic malfeasance and malicious politicization of our country&rsquo;s justice system. The law was weaponized for partisan purposes. Even though it was Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s campaign that collected and disseminated a trove of lies about Trump from a former British spy and Russian operatives, Democrats and the media spun this into a claim that Trump was working for the Russians.</br> </br> Senior officials at the FBI, blinded by their political bias and hatred of Trump, went after the wrong person. At the DOJ, the deputy attorney general discussed secretly recording the president and recruiting members of the cabinet to depose Trump. Those behind the Witch Hunt have either been fired or resigned.&#160; Many of them are now under investigation for abuse of power. But what about the pundits who concocted wild narratives in real time on television, or the newspapers which covered the fact that rumors were being investigated without investigating the facts themselves?</br> </br> Factual, highly persuasive, and damning, this must-read expose makes clear that not only was there no &ldquo;collusion,&rdquo; but there was not even a basis for Mueller&rsquo;s investigation of the charge that has attacked Trump and his administration for more than two years.

After oil was discovered beneath their land, they rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.<br> &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;Then, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. Her relatives were shot and poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more and more members of the tribe began to die under mysterious circumstances. <br> &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;In this last remnant of the Wild West&mdash;where oilmen like J. P. Getty made their fortunes and where desperadoes like Al Spencer, the &ldquo;Phantom Terror,&rdquo; roamed&mdash;many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll climbed to more than twenty-four, the FBI took up the case. It was one of the organization&rsquo;s first major homicide investigations and the bureau badly bungled the case. In desperation, the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including one of the only American Indian agents in the bureau. The agents infiltrated the region, struggling to adopt the latest techniques of detection.&#160; Together with the Osage they began to expose one of the most chilling conspiracies in American history.&#160;<br> &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;In <i>Killers of the Flower Moon, </i>David Grann revisits a shocking series of crimes in which dozens of people were murdered in cold blood. Based on years of research and startling new evidence, the book is a masterpiece of narrative nonfiction, as each step in the investigation reveals a series of sinister secrets and reversals. But more than that, it is a searing indictment of the callousness and prejudice toward American Indians that allowed the murderers to operate with impunity for so long. <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> is utterly compelling, but also emotionally devastating.

The rational mind wants to change something at work; the emotional mind loves the comfort of the existing routine. This tension can doom a change effort - but if it is overcome, change can come quickly.<br><br>In <i><b>Switch</b></i>, the Heaths show how everyday people - employees and managers, parents and nurses - have united both minds and, as a result, achieved dramatic results&#58;<br><br>- The lowly medical interns who managed to defeat an entrenched, decades-old medical practice that was endangering patients<br>- The home-organizing guru who developed a simple technique for overcoming the dread of housekeeping&#160;<br>- The manager who transformed a lackadaisical customer-support team into service zealots by <i>removing</i> a standard tool of customer service&#160;<br><br>In a compelling, story-driven narrative, the Heaths bring together decades of counterintuitive research in psychology, sociology, and other fields to shed new light on how we can effect transformative change. <i><b>Switch</b> </i>shows that successful changes follow a pattern, a pattern you can use to make the changes that matter to you, whether your interest is in changing the world or changing your waistline.
9780316556347|<br><strong>"A bold and subversive retelling of the goddess's story," this #1 New York Times bestseller is "both epic and intimate in its scope, recasting the most infamous female figure from the Odyssey as a hero in her own right" (Alexandra Alter, <em>The New York Times</em>).</strong> <br> <br>In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child -- not powerful like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power -- the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves. <br> <br>Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts, and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus. But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. <br> <br>To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love. With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and page-turning suspense, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, love and loss, as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man's world. <br> <br><strong>#1 New York Times bestseller -- named one of the best books of the year by NPR, the Washington Post, People, Time, Amazon, Entertainment Weekly, Bustle, Newsweek, the A.V.

Now, based on new research conducted with leaders, change makers, and culture shifters, she&rsquo;s showing us how to put those ideas into practice so we can step up and lead.</b><br><br> Leadership is not about titles, status, and wielding power. A leader is anyone who takes responsibility for recognizing the potential in people and ideas, and has the courage to develop that potential.<br><br> When we dare to lead, we don&rsquo;t pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don&rsquo;t see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it with others. We don&rsquo;t avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into vulnerability when it&rsquo;s necessary to do good work.<br><br> But daring leadership in a culture defined by scarcity, fear, and uncertainty requires skill-building around traits that are deeply and uniquely human. The irony is that we&rsquo;re choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the exact same time as we&rsquo;re scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines and AI can&rsquo;t do better and faster. What can <i>we</i> do better? Empathy, connection, and courage, to start.<br><br> Four-time #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Bren&eacute; Brown has spent the past two decades studying the emotions and experiences that give meaning to our lives, and the past seven years working with transformative leaders and teams spanning the globe. She found that leaders in organizations ranging from small entrepreneurial startups and family-owned businesses to nonprofits, civic organizations, and Fortune 50 companies all ask the same question&#58;&#160;<br><br> <b>How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders, and how do you embed the value of courage in your culture?&#160;</b><br><br> In this new book, Brown uses research, stories, and examples to answer these questions in the no-BS<i> </i>style that millions of readers have come to expect and love.<br><br> Brown writes, &ldquo;One of the most important findings of my career is that daring leadership is a collection of skills and practices that are 100 percent teachable. It&rsquo;s learning and unlearning that requires brave work, tough conversations, and showing up with your whole heart. Easy? No. Because choosing courage over comfort is not always our default. Worth it? Always. We want to be brave with our lives and our work. It&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;<br><br>Whether you&rsquo;ve read <i>Daring Greatly </i>and<i> Rising Strong</i> or you&rsquo;re new to Bren&eacute; Brown&rsquo;s work, this book is for anyone who wants to step up and into brave leadership.

The Education of an Idealist traces Power&#8217;s distinctly American journey from immigrant to war correspondent to presidential Cabinet official. In 2005, her critiques of US foreign policy caught the eye of newly elected senator Barack Obama, who invited her to work with him on Capitol Hill and then on his presidential campaign. After Obama was elected president, Power went from being an activist outsider to a government insider, navigating the halls of power while trying to put her ideals into practice. She served for four years as Obama&#8217;s human rights adviser, and in 2013, he named her US Ambassador to the United Nations, the youngest American to assume the role.</p> <p>Power transports us from her childhood in Dublin to the streets of war-torn Bosnia to the White House Situation Room and the world of high-stakes diplomacy. Humorous and deeply honest, The Education of an Idealist lays bare the searing battles and defining moments of her life and shows how she juggled the demands of a 24/7 national security job with the challenge of raising two young children. Along the way, she illuminates the intricacies of politics and geopolitics, reminding us how the United States can lead in the world, and why we each have the opportunity to advance the cause of human dignity. Power&#8217;s memoir is an unforgettable account of the power of idealism and of one person&#8217;s fierce determination to make a difference.</p>

9780143034759|<P>A&#160;<i>New York Times</i>&#160;Bestseller, and&#160;<b>the inspiration for the hit Broadway musical&#160;<i>Hamilton</i>!</b><br><br>Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow presents a landmark biography of Alexander Hamilton, the Founding Father who galvanized, inspired, scandalized, and shaped the newborn nation.<br><br>In the first full-length biography of Alexander Hamilton in decades, Ron Chernow tells the riveting story of a man who overcame all odds to shape, inspire, and scandalize the newborn America. According to historian Joseph Ellis,&#160;<b><i>Alexander Hamilton</i></b>&#160;is &ldquo;a robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.&rdquo;<br><br>Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow&rsquo;s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today&rsquo;s America is the result of Hamilton&rsquo;s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. &ldquo;To repudiate his legacy,&rdquo; Chernow writes, &ldquo;is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.&rdquo; Chernow here recounts Hamilton&rsquo;s turbulent life&#58; an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington&rsquo;s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of America&rsquo;s birth as the triumph of Jefferson&rsquo;s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we&rsquo;ve encountered before&mdash;from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton&rsquo;s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.<br><br>Chernow&rsquo;s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America&rsquo;s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots,&#160;<b><i>Alexander Hamilton</i></b>&#160;will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans.<br><br>&ldquo;Nobody has captured Hamilton better than Chernow&rdquo;&#160;&mdash;<b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i>&#160;</b><br><br><b>Ron Chernow's other biographies include&#58;&#160;<i>Grant</i>, <i>Washington</i>, and <i>Titan.</i></b></p>

9780385521697|<b>From the host of the Travel Channel&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Wild Within.&rdquo;</b><br><br>A hunt for the American buffalo&mdash;an adventurous, fascinating examination of an animal that has haunted the American imagination.<br>&#160;<br>In 2005, Steven Rinella won a lottery permit to hunt for a wild buffalo, or American bison, in the Alaskan wilderness.&#160;Despite the odds&mdash;there&rsquo;s only a 2 percent chance of drawing the permit, and fewer than 20 percent of those hunters are successful&mdash;Rinella managed to kill a buffalo on a snow-covered mountainside and then raft the meat back to civilization while being trailed by grizzly bears and suffering from hypothermia. Throughout these adventures, Rinella found himself contemplating his own place among the 14,000 years&rsquo; worth of buffalo hunters in North America, as well as the buffalo&rsquo;s place in the American experience. At the time of the Revolutionary War, North America was home to approximately 40 million buffalo, the largest herd of big mammals on the planet, but by the mid-1890s only a few hundred remained. Now that the buffalo is on the verge of a dramatic ecological recovery across the West, Americans are faced with the challenge of how, and if, we can dare to share our land with a beast that is the embodiment of the American wilderness. <br><br> <i>American Buffalo</i> is a narrative tale of Rinella&rsquo;s hunt. But beyond that, it is the story of the many ways in which the buffalo has shaped our national identity. Rinella takes us across the continent in search of the buffalo&rsquo;s past, present, and future&#58; to the Bering Land Bridge, where scientists search for buffalo bones amid artifacts of the New World&rsquo;s earliest human inhabitants; to buffalo jumps where Native Americans once ran buffalo over cliffs by the thousands; to the Detroit Carbon works, a &ldquo;bone charcoal&rdquo; plant that made fortunes in the late 1800s by turning millions of tons of buffalo bones into bone meal, black dye, and fine china; and even to an abattoir turned fashion mecca in Manhattan&rsquo;s Meatpacking District, where a depressed buffalo named Black Diamond met his fate after serving as the model for the American nickel.<br><br>&#160;Rinella&rsquo;s erudition and exuberance, combined with his gift for storytelling, make him the perfect guide for a book that combines outdoor adventure with a quirky blend of facts and observations about history, biology, and the natural world. Both a captivating narrative and a book of environmental and historical significance, <i>American Buffalo</i> tells us as much about ourselves as Americans as it does about the creature who perhaps best of all embodies the American ethos.

After oil was discovered beneath their land, they rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.<br> &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;Then, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. Her relatives were shot and poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more and more members of the tribe began to die under mysterious circumstances. <br> &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;In this last remnant of the Wild West&mdash;where oilmen like J. P. Getty made their fortunes and where desperadoes like Al Spencer, the &ldquo;Phantom Terror,&rdquo; roamed&mdash;many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll climbed to more than twenty-four, the FBI took up the case. It was one of the organization&rsquo;s first major homicide investigations and the bureau badly bungled the case. In desperation, the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including one of the only American Indian agents in the bureau. The agents infiltrated the region, struggling to adopt the latest techniques of detection.&#160; Together with the Osage they began to expose one of the most chilling conspiracies in American history.&#160;<br> &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;In <i>Killers of the Flower Moon, </i>David Grann revisits a shocking series of crimes in which dozens of people were murdered in cold blood. Based on years of research and startling new evidence, the book is a masterpiece of narrative nonfiction, as each step in the investigation reveals a series of sinister secrets and reversals. But more than that, it is a searing indictment of the callousness and prejudice toward American Indians that allowed the murderers to operate with impunity for so long. <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> is utterly compelling, but also emotionally devastating.

But Bane&#8217;s acolyte, Zannah, has yet to engage her Master in mortal combat and prove herself a worthy successor. Determined that the Sith dream of galactic domination will not die with him, Bane vows to learn the secret of a forgotten Dark Lord that will assure the Sith&#8217;s immortality&#8211;and his own.<br><br>A perfect opportunity arises when a Jedi emissary is assassinated on the troubled mining planet Doan, giving Bane an excuse to dispatch his apprentice on a fact-finding mission&#8211;while he himself sets out in secret to capture the ancient holocron of Darth Andeddu and its precious knowledge. But Zannah is no fool. She knows that her ruthless Master has begun to doubt her, and she senses that he is hiding something crucial to her future. If she is going to claim the power she craves, she must take action now. <br><br>While Bane storms the remote stronghold of a fanatical Sith cult, Zannah prepares for her Master&#8217;s downfall by choosing an apprentice of her own&#58; a rogue Jedi cunning and cold-blooded enough to embrace the Sith way and to stand beside her when she at last wrests from Bane the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith. <br><br>But Zannah is not the only one with the desire and power to destroy Darth Bane. Princess Serra of the Doan royal family is haunted by memories of the monstrous Sith soldier who murdered her father and tortured her when she was a child.

They never saw her again. Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles. Everyone in the neighborhood knew the I.R.A. was responsible. But in a climate of fear and paranoia, no one would speak of it. In 2003, five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland, a set of human bones was discovered on a beach.

The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children, but also I.R.A. members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland, and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war, but simple murders. From radical and impetuous I.R.A. terrorists such as Dolours Price, who, when she was barely out of her teens, was already planting bombs in London and targeting informers for execution, to the ferocious I.R.A. mastermind known as The Dark, to the spy games and dirty schemes of the British Army, to Gerry Adams, who negotiated the peace but betrayed his hardcore comrades by denying his I.R.A. past&#151;<i>Say Nothing</i> conjures a world of passion, betrayal, vengeance, and anguish.

Meredith, an investment banker, has achieved partnership in one of Wall Street's top firms. Steve, a gifted physician, chose an urban trauma ward over the big money he could have earned elsewhere. The only thing missing in their lives is children. Steve longs for them. But Meredith keeps putting motherhood off, saying she isn't ready and doesn't have time. Not yet. Especially now that she has been offered an extraordinary opportunity, a chance to reach for the brass-ring in San Francisco, three thousand miles away. Meredith is thrilled and surprised when Steve urges her to accept a top position at an exciting young high-tech company. Traditionally, men's careers force families to move to new cities, compelling their wives to abandon their friends, homes, and lives to follow.

Perhaps in California, he hopes, they can begin their family at last.<br><br>Neither Steve nor Meredith had reckoned on the frustrations of a bi-coastal marriage, as Steve's job keeps him in New York for months longer than planned. Weekends together, their lifeline, fall prey to their hectic schedules. Alone in San Francisco, Meredith is spending long hours at the office with her boss, charismatic entrepreneur Callan Dow. Steve is working late shifts at the hospital, grabbing an occasional dinner with a new colleague, a doctor raising a daughter on her own.

But the deadliest predator was already among them, and within a week, he walked away with the blood of all but one of them on his hands.<br> &#160;<br> Now this killer has chosen Boston as his new hunting ground, and Rizzoli and Isles must find a way to lure him out of the shadows and into a cage. Even if it means dangling the bait no hunter can resist&#58; the one victim who got away.<br><br><b>Advance praise for <i>Die Again</i></b><br> <b>&#160;</b><br>&ldquo;With <i>Die Again,</i> Tess Gerritsen proves that she is still at the top of her game.

9780399589829|<P><b>#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER &bull; Pulitzer Prize&ndash;winning author Jon Meacham helps us understand the present moment in American politics and life by looking back at critical times in our history when hope overcame division and fear.</b><br><br><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR &bull; <i>The Christian Science Monitor </i>&bull; <i>Southern Living</i></b><br><br> Our current climate of partisan fury is not new, and in <i>The Soul of America</i> Meacham shows us how what Abraham Lincoln called the &ldquo;better angels of our nature&rdquo; have repeatedly won the day. Painting surprising portraits of Lincoln and other presidents, including Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and Lyndon B. Johnson, and illuminating the courage of such influential citizen activists as Martin Luther King, Jr., early suffragettes Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt, civil rights pioneers Rosa Parks and John Lewis, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Army-McCarthy hearings lawyer Joseph N. Welch, Meacham brings vividly to life turning points in American history. He writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the birth of the Lost Cause; the backlash against immigrants in the First World War and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s; the fight for women&rsquo;s rights; the demagoguery of Huey Long and Father Coughlin and the isolationist work of America First in the years before World War II; the anti-Communist witch-hunts led by Senator Joseph McCarthy; and Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s crusade against Jim Crow. Each of these dramatic hours in our national life have been shaped by the contest to lead the country to look forward rather than back, to assert hope over fear&mdash;a struggle that continues even now.<br><br>While the American story has not always&mdash;or even often&mdash;been heroic, we have been sustained by a belief in progress even in the gloomiest of times. In this inspiring book, Meacham reassures us,&#160;&ldquo;The good news is that we have come through such darkness before&rdquo;&mdash;as, time and again, Lincoln&rsquo;s better angels have found a way to prevail.<br><b><br>Praise for <i>The Soul of America</i></b><br><br> &ldquo;Brilliant, fascinating, timely . . . With compelling narratives of past eras of strife and disenchantment, Meacham offers wisdom for our own time.&rdquo;<b>&mdash;Walter Isaacson</b><br><br> &ldquo;Gripping and inspiring, <i>The Soul of America</i> is Jon Meacham&rsquo;s declaration of his faith in America.&rdquo;<b>&mdash;<i>Newsday</i></b><br><br>&ldquo;Meacham gives readers a long-term perspective on American history and a reason to believe the soul of America is ultimately one of kindness and caring, not rancor and paranoia.&rdquo;<b>&mdash;<i>USA Today</i></b>

"F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let&#8217;s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Mason doesn&#8217;t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is&#8212;a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is his antidote to the coddling, let&#8217;s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. </p><p>Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited&#8212;"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. </p><p>There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.</p>

People with a <i>fixed mindset</i>&mdash;those who believe that abilities are fixed&mdash;are less likely to flourish than those with a <i>growth mindset</i>&mdash;those who believe that abilities can be developed. <i>Mindset</i> reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.<br><br> In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love&mdash;to transform their lives and your own.<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Mindset</i></b><br><br>&ldquo;A good book is one whose advice you believe. A great book is one whose advice you follow. This is a book that can change your life, as its ideas have changed mine.&rdquo;<b>&mdash;Robert J. Sternberg, co-author of <i>Teaching for Wisdom, Intelligence, Creativity, and Success</i></b><br><br> &ldquo;An essential read for parents, teachers [and] coaches . . . as well as for those who would like to increase their own feelings of success and fulfillment.&rdquo;<b><i>&mdash;Library Journal </i>(starred review)</b><br><br> &ldquo;Everyone should read this book.&rdquo;<b>&mdash;Chip Heath and Dan Heath, authors of <i>Made to Stick</i></b><br><br> &ldquo;One of the most influential books ever about motivation.&rdquo;<b>&mdash;Po Bronson, author of <i>NurtureShock</i></b><br><br> &ldquo;If you manage people or are a parent (which is a form of managing people), drop everything and read <i>Mindset</i>.&rdquo;<b>&mdash;Guy Kawasaki, author of <i>The Art of the Start 2.0</i></b>

9780062300553|From a former marine and Yale Law School graduate, a powerful account of growing up in a poor Rust Belt town that offers a broader, probing look at the struggles of America's white working class.Hillbilly Elegy is a passionate and personal analysis of a culture in crisis--that of white working-class Americans. The decline of this group, a demographic of our country that has been slowly disintegrating over forty years, has been reported on with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck.The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.'s grandparents were "dirt poor and in love," and moved north from Kentucky's Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually their grandchild (the author) would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of their success in achieving generational upward mobility.But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out, we learn that this is only the short, superficial version. Vance's grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother, struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, and were never able to fully escape the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. Vance piercingly shows how he himself still carries around the demons of their chaotic family history.A deeply moving memoir with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, Hillbilly Elegy is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.

9780062427137|<P>"I read this book... it worked. My autoimmune disease is gone and I'm&#160;37 pounds lighter in my pleather." &#151;Kelly Clarkson</p><P>Most of us have heard of gluten&#8212;a protein found in wheat that causes widespread inflammation in the body. Americans spend billions of dollars on gluten-free diets in an effort to protect their health. But what if we&#8217;ve been missing the root of the problem? In <i>The Plant Paradox</i>, renowned cardiologist Dr. Steven Gundry reveals that gluten is just one variety of a common, and highly toxic, plant-based protein called lectin. Lectins are found not only in grains like wheat but also in the &#8220;gluten-free&#8221; foods most of us commonly regard as healthy, including many fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, and conventional dairy products. These proteins, which are found in the seeds, grains, skins, rinds, and leaves of plants, are designed by nature to protect them from predators (including humans). Once ingested, they incite a kind of chemical warfare in our bodies, causing inflammatory reactions that can lead to weight gain and serious health conditions.</p><P>At his waitlist-only clinics in California, Dr. Gundry has successfully treated tens of thousands of patients suffering from autoimmune disorders, diabetes, leaky gut syndrome, heart disease, and neurodegenerative diseases with a protocol that detoxes the cells, repairs the gut, and nourishes the body. Now, in <i>The Plant Paradox</i>, he shares this clinically proven program with readers around the world.</p><P>The simple (and daunting) fact is, lectins are everywhere. Thankfully, Dr. Gundry offers simple hacks we easily can employ to avoid them, including&#58;</p><ul><li>Peel your veggies. Most of the lectins are contained in the skin and seeds of plants; simply peeling and de-seeding vegetables (like tomatoes and peppers) reduces their lectin content.</li><li>Shop for fruit in season. Fruit contain fewer lectins when ripe, so eating apples, berries, and other lectin-containing fruits at the peak of ripeness helps minimize your lectin consumption.</li><li>Swap your brown rice for white. Whole grains and seeds with hard outer coatings are designed by nature to cause digestive distress&#8212;and are full of lectins.</li></ul><P>With a full list of lectin-containing foods and simple substitutes for each, a step-by-step detox and eating plan, and delicious lectin-free recipes, <i>The Plant Paradox</i> illuminates the hidden dangers lurking in your salad bowl&#8212;and shows you how to eat whole foods in a whole new way.</p>

Now in Kellerman's most compelling and powerful novel yet, L.A. psychologist-detective Alex Delaware confronts a long-unsolved murder of unspeakable brutality -- an ice-cold case whose resolution threatens his survival, and that of longtime friend, homicide detective, Milo Sturgis.</p><p>The nightmare begins when Alex receives a strange package in the mail with no return address. Inside is an ornate album filled with gruesome crime scene photos -- a homicide scrapbook entitled The Murder Book.
