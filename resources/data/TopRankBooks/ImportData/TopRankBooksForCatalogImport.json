It could also endanger her life.<P><B>A Note from the Author:</B><P>The story behind <i>The Hate U Give</i> by Angie Thomas<br><br>I remember the first time I saw Emmett Louis Till.<br>I couldn&rsquo;t have been more than eight years old. I came across his photo in a Jet magazine that marked the anniversary of his death. At the time, I was convinced he wasn&rsquo;t real, or at least that he wasn&rsquo;t a person. What was supposed to be a face was mutilated beyond recognition. He looked more like a prop from a movie to me; a monster from some over-the-top horror flick.<br>But he was a person, a boy, and his story was a cautionary tale, even for a black girl in Mississippi who was born more than three decades after he died. &ldquo;Know your worth,&rdquo; my mom would say, &ldquo;but also know that not everyone values you as much as I do.&rdquo;<br>Still, Emmett wasn&rsquo;t real to me. There was no way I&rsquo;d ever have to worry about anything like that happening to me or to someone I knew. Things had changed, even in Mississippi. That was history. The present had its own problems<br>I grew up in a neighborhood that&rsquo;s notorious for all the wrong reasons. Drug dealers, shootings, crime, insert other &ldquo;ghetto&rdquo; stereotypes here. While everything they showed on the news was true, there was so much more that you wouldn&rsquo;t see unless you lived there.  It was my home. My neighbors were family. The neighborhood drug dealer was a superhero who gave kids money for snacks and beat up pedophiles who tried to snatch little girls off the street. The cops could be superheroes too, but I was taught at a young age to be &ldquo;mindful&rdquo; around them. So had my friends. We&rsquo;d all heard stories, and though they didn&rsquo;t come with mutilated photos, they were realer than Emmett. <br><br>I remember the first time I saw the video of Oscar Grant.<br>I was a transfer student in my first year at the college I&rsquo;d later graduate from. It was in a nicer part of town than where I lived, but only ten minutes away from it, and it was very, very white. A majority of the time, I was the only black student in my creative writing classes. I did everything I could so no one would label me as the &ldquo;black girl from the hood.&rdquo; I would leave home, blasting Tupac, but by the time I arrived to pick up a friend, I was listening to the Jonas Brothers. I kept quiet whenever race came up in discussions, despite the glances I&rsquo;d get because as the &ldquo;token black girl,&rdquo; I was expected to speak. <br>But Oscar did something to me. Suddenly, Emmett wasn&rsquo;t history. Emmett was still reality.  <br>The video was shocking for multiple reasons, one being that someone actually caught it on tape. This was undeniable evidence that had never been provided for the stories I&rsquo;d heard. Yet my classmates, who had never heard such tales, had their own opinions about it.<br>&ldquo;He should&rsquo;ve just done what they said.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He was resisting.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I heard he was an ex-con and a drug dealer.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He had it coming. Why are people so mad?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They were just doing their job.&rdquo;<br>And I hate to admit it, but I still remained silent.<br>I was hurt, no doubt. And angry. Frustrated. Straight-up pissed. I knew plenty of Oscars. I grew up with them and I was friends with them. This was like being told that they deserved to die. <br>As the unrest took place in Oakland, I wondered how my community would react if that happened to one of our Oscars. I also wondered if my classmates would make the same comments if I became an Oscar. I wasn&rsquo;t an ex-con or a drug dealer, but I was from a neighborhood they were afraid to visit, the same neighborhood they once jokingly said was full of criminals, not knowing that&rsquo;s where I lived until months later. <br>From all of those questions and emotions, <i>The Hate U Give</i> was born.<br>I&rsquo;ve always told stories. When I can&rsquo;t find a way to say the words out loud, I create characters who do it for me. <i>The Hate U Give</i> started as a short story my senior year. It was cathartic at the time, and I thought I was done telling Starr and Khalil&rsquo;s story because I foolishly hoped Oscar wouldn&rsquo;t happen again.<br>But then there was Trayvon. Michael. Eric. Tamir.<br>And there was more anger, frustration, and hurt for me, my peers, and the kids in my neighborhood who saw themselves in those gentlemen. So I expressed those feelings the best way I knew how, through story, in hopes that I would give a voice to every kid who feels the same way I do and is not sure how to express it. <br>But my ultimate hope is that everyone who reads this book, no matter their experiences, walks away from it understanding those feelings and sharing them in some way.<br>And maybe then, Emmett Louis Till can truly become history. <br>","Price":18.99,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":12,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmdDhyeiJgykagGNkTfoSKuQkFHXeURCcfJwFV9otFv4KR","PictureSmallUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmWF4q1hBMrajV5d2FzYzxN9HKW8MNj2ybng9XJi7Zrsdm","PictureMediumUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmdDhyeiJgykagGNkTfoSKuQkFHXeURCcfJwFV9otFv4KR","PictureLargeUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmSDwxbo6MWmrjzwRxhzAiDMiQKFGrcBazSisEKdmosJBy","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"2017\",\"Author\":\"Angie Thomas\",\"Publisher\":\"Balzer + Bray, an imprint of HarperCollinsPublishers\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"444\",\"Subject Time\":\"21st century\",\"Subject\":\"Fiction\",\"Age Min\":\"14\",\"Age Max\":\"17\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"YAF046120\"}","Rank":12,"Height":209,"Width":139,"Depth":35,"Weight":0,"Id":12},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780062457714","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"The Subtle Art of Not Giving A FUCK","Description":"<p><strong>#1 <em>New York Times</em> Bestseller</strong></p><p><strong>Over&#160;5 million copies sold</strong></p><p>In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be \"positive\" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.</p><p>For decades, we&#8217;ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. \"F**k positivity,\" Mark Manson says. \"Let&#8217;s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it.\" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Mason doesn&#8217;t sugarcoat or equivocate.

Washington insiders broke rule after rule investigating the president, chasing a conspiracy that turned out not to exist. Somehow this was spun into Donald Trump having something to hide. People associated with the president were pushed into plea deals that had nothing to do with Russian &ldquo;collusion&rdquo; or discouraged from serving by the threat of huge legal bills. Somehow this was spun into Trump&rsquo;s lawyers being bullies. The president complained that the investigation was a waste of time, but he allowed it to continue unimpeded to the end. Somehow this was spun into obstruction of justice.</br> </br> In <em>Witch Hun</em><em>t</em>,&#160;Gregg Jarrett uncovers the bureaucratic malfeasance and malicious politicization of our country&rsquo;s justice system. The law was weaponized for partisan purposes. Even though it was Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s campaign that collected and disseminated a trove of lies about Trump from a former British spy and Russian operatives, Democrats and the media spun this into a claim that Trump was working for the Russians.</br> </br> Senior officials at the FBI, blinded by their political bias and hatred of Trump, went after the wrong person. At the DOJ, the deputy attorney general discussed secretly recording the president and recruiting members of the cabinet to depose Trump. Those behind the Witch Hunt have either been fired or resigned.&#160; Many of them are now under investigation for abuse of power. But what about the pundits who concocted wild narratives in real time on television, or the newspapers which covered the fact that rumors were being investigated without investigating the facts themselves?</br> </br> Factual, highly persuasive, and damning, this must-read expose makes clear that not only was there no &ldquo;collusion,&rdquo; but there was not even a basis for Mueller&rsquo;s investigation of the charge that has attacked Trump and his administration for more than two years.

After oil was discovered beneath their land, they rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.<br> &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;Then, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. Her relatives were shot and poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more and more members of the tribe began to die under mysterious circumstances. <br> &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;In this last remnant of the Wild West&mdash;where oilmen like J. P. Getty made their fortunes and where desperadoes like Al Spencer, the &ldquo;Phantom Terror,&rdquo; roamed&mdash;many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll climbed to more than twenty-four, the FBI took up the case. It was one of the organization&rsquo;s first major homicide investigations and the bureau badly bungled the case. In desperation, the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including one of the only American Indian agents in the bureau. The agents infiltrated the region, struggling to adopt the latest techniques of detection.&#160; Together with the Osage they began to expose one of the most chilling conspiracies in American history.&#160;<br> &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;In <i>Killers of the Flower Moon, </i>David Grann revisits a shocking series of crimes in which dozens of people were murdered in cold blood. Based on years of research and startling new evidence, the book is a masterpiece of narrative nonfiction, as each step in the investigation reveals a series of sinister secrets and reversals. But more than that, it is a searing indictment of the callousness and prejudice toward American Indians that allowed the murderers to operate with impunity for so long. <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> is utterly compelling, but also emotionally devastating.","Price":16.95,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":49,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmP5Ggb28nmCKMrG7tYx9z6ULdjENNWm8jTAu4rw8HETJX","PictureSmallUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmbJr6TKQcYFj3gF1iumoVtEQCPWV3Cq9Nj58GRWuJ9EPu","PictureMediumUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmP5Ggb28nmCKMrG7tYx9z6ULdjENNWm8jTAu4rw8HETJX","PictureLargeUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmQskJFeTbR7v9mAPvLFbFFSLHSZydeEahS4qHV8wAvh2R","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"Apr 03, 2018\",\"Author\":\"David Grann\",\"Publisher\":\"Vintage\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"400\",\"Subject Time\":\"\",\"Subject\":\"\",\"Age Min\":\"\",\"Age Max\":\"\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"TRU002000\"}","Rank":55,"Height":202,"Width":131,"Depth":20,"Weight":0,"Id":55},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780394820378","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"The Phantom Tollbooth - Wikipedia","Description":"This tale of 10-year-old Milo and his experiences in the \"Lands Beyond\" has become a modern-day children's classic.","Price":8.99,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":50,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmYkxZ3fHhYuF1ZK3w1YMG5YLdKa5BCKo6u7Xp5hRFiZw6","PictureSmallUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmWnLQwfgHvyzqSMpyb8QeosgubznCdpuBkdy3WAey8DdY","PictureMediumUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmYkxZ3fHhYuF1ZK3w1YMG5YLdKa5BCKo6u7Xp5hRFiZw6","PictureLargeUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/Qmde91w5vGB2PpR5def1DXGuF2uqwr4JdP6avtqKoKYYm7","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"1989\",\"Author\":\"Norton Juster\",\"Publisher\":\"Bullseye Books/Alfred A.

But Circe is a strange child -- not powerful like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power -- the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves. <br> <br>Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts, and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus. But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. <br> <br>To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love. With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and page-turning suspense, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, love and loss, as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man's world. <br> <br><strong>#1 New York Times bestseller -- named one of the best books of the year by NPR, the Washington Post, People, Time, Amazon, Entertainment Weekly, Bustle, Newsweek, the A.V.

A leader is anyone who takes responsibility for recognizing the potential in people and ideas, and has the courage to develop that potential.<br><br> When we dare to lead, we don&rsquo;t pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don&rsquo;t see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it with others. We don&rsquo;t avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into vulnerability when it&rsquo;s necessary to do good work.<br><br> But daring leadership in a culture defined by scarcity, fear, and uncertainty requires skill-building around traits that are deeply and uniquely human.

But Circe is a strange child -- not powerful like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power -- the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves. <br> <br>Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts, and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus. But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. <br> <br>To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love. With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and page-turning suspense, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, love and loss, as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man's world. <br> <br><strong>#1 New York Times bestseller -- named one of the best books of the year by NPR, the Washington Post, People, Time, Amazon, Entertainment Weekly, Bustle, Newsweek, the A.V.

The Education of an Idealist traces Power&#8217;s distinctly American journey from immigrant to war correspondent to presidential Cabinet official. In 2005, her critiques of US foreign policy caught the eye of newly elected senator Barack Obama, who invited her to work with him on Capitol Hill and then on his presidential campaign. After Obama was elected president, Power went from being an activist outsider to a government insider, navigating the halls of power while trying to put her ideals into practice.

Humorous and deeply honest, The Education of an Idealist lays bare the searing battles and defining moments of her life and shows how she juggled the demands of a 24/7 national security job with the challenge of raising two young children. Along the way, she illuminates the intricacies of politics and geopolitics, reminding us how the United States can lead in the world, and why we each have the opportunity to advance the cause of human dignity.

According to historian Joseph Ellis,&#160;<b><i>Alexander Hamilton</i></b>&#160;is &ldquo;a robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.&rdquo;<br><br>Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow&rsquo;s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today&rsquo;s America is the result of Hamilton&rsquo;s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. &ldquo;To repudiate his legacy,&rdquo; Chernow writes, &ldquo;is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.&rdquo; Chernow here recounts Hamilton&rsquo;s turbulent life&#58; an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington&rsquo;s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of America&rsquo;s birth as the triumph of Jefferson&rsquo;s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we&rsquo;ve encountered before&mdash;from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton&rsquo;s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.<br><br>Chernow&rsquo;s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America&rsquo;s birth seen through its most central figure.

Throughout these adventures, Rinella found himself contemplating his own place among the 14,000 years&rsquo; worth of buffalo hunters in North America, as well as the buffalo&rsquo;s place in the American experience. At the time of the Revolutionary War, North America was home to approximately 40 million buffalo, the largest herd of big mammals on the planet, but by the mid-1890s only a few hundred remained. Now that the buffalo is on the verge of a dramatic ecological recovery across the West, Americans are faced with the challenge of how, and if, we can dare to share our land with a beast that is the embodiment of the American wilderness. <br><br> <i>American Buffalo</i> is a narrative tale of Rinella&rsquo;s hunt. But beyond that, it is the story of the many ways in which the buffalo has shaped our national identity. Rinella takes us across the continent in search of the buffalo&rsquo;s past, present, and future&#58; to the Bering Land Bridge, where scientists search for buffalo bones amid artifacts of the New World&rsquo;s earliest human inhabitants; to buffalo jumps where Native Americans once ran buffalo over cliffs by the thousands; to the Detroit Carbon works, a &ldquo;bone charcoal&rdquo; plant that made fortunes in the late 1800s by turning millions of tons of buffalo bones into bone meal, black dye, and fine china; and even to an abattoir turned fashion mecca in Manhattan&rsquo;s Meatpacking District, where a depressed buffalo named Black Diamond met his fate after serving as the model for the American nickel.<br><br>&#160;Rinella&rsquo;s erudition and exuberance, combined with his gift for storytelling, make him the perfect guide for a book that combines outdoor adventure with a quirky blend of facts and observations about history, biology, and the natural world. Both a captivating narrative and a book of environmental and historical significance, <i>American Buffalo</i> tells us as much about ourselves as Americans as it does about the creature who perhaps best of all embodies the American ethos.","Price":18.0,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":28,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"","PictureSmallUri":"","PictureMediumUri":"","PictureLargeUri":"","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"2009\",\"Author\":\"Steven Rinella\",\"Publisher\":\"Spiegel & Grau\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"289\",\"Subject Time\":\"\",\"Subject\":\"American bison\",\"Age Min\":\"\",\"Age Max\":\"\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"599.64/\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"NAT037000\"}","Rank":110,"Height":203,"Width":129,"Depth":15,"Weight":0,"Id":110},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780399581427","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"Simple Cake","Description":"<P><b>A nostalgic ode to the joy of homemade cake, beautifully photographed and with easy mix-and-match recipes for a sweet lift any day of the week.</b><br><br><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST COOKBOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>THE NEW YORK TIMES </i>AND <i>FOOD52</i></b><br><br>Everyone has a favorite style of cake, whether it's citrusy and fresh or chocolatey and indulgent.

After oil was discovered beneath their land, they rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.<br> &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;Then, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. Her relatives were shot and poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more and more members of the tribe began to die under mysterious circumstances. <br> &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;In this last remnant of the Wild West&mdash;where oilmen like J. P. Getty made their fortunes and where desperadoes like Al Spencer, the &ldquo;Phantom Terror,&rdquo; roamed&mdash;many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll climbed to more than twenty-four, the FBI took up the case. It was one of the organization&rsquo;s first major homicide investigations and the bureau badly bungled the case. In desperation, the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including one of the only American Indian agents in the bureau. The agents infiltrated the region, struggling to adopt the latest techniques of detection.&#160; Together with the Osage they began to expose one of the most chilling conspiracies in American history.&#160;<br> &#160; &#160; &#160;&#160;In <i>Killers of the Flower Moon, </i>David Grann revisits a shocking series of crimes in which dozens of people were murdered in cold blood. Based on years of research and startling new evidence, the book is a masterpiece of narrative nonfiction, as each step in the investigation reveals a series of sinister secrets and reversals. But more than that, it is a searing indictment of the callousness and prejudice toward American Indians that allowed the murderers to operate with impunity for so long. <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> is utterly compelling, but also emotionally devastating.","Price":11.99,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":49,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmYuCtTJKEh5heoBoWF1vqjr8QGxM6tDWqqsZUZLgUrmHF","PictureSmallUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmTjmprGhgxTzY1Z2cxyiPiKD2cLr119X6w4KotCE4eedt","PictureMediumUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmYuCtTJKEh5heoBoWF1vqjr8QGxM6tDWqqsZUZLgUrmHF","PictureLargeUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmfZ9rzQhyoury2uLsCdQWEm74cLfmziCcukf6rJgexH8U","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"Apr 18, 2017\",\"Author\":\"David Grann\",\"Publisher\":\"Vintage\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"347\",\"Subject Time\":\"\",\"Subject\":\"\",\"Age Min\":\"\",\"Age Max\":\"\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"TRU002000\"}","Rank":129,"Height":0,"Width":0,"Depth":0,"Weight":0,"Id":129},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780316071727","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"Nine Dragons","Description":"<P><b>After what seems like a routine murder investigation, LAPD Detective Harry Bosch finds himself in Hong Kong facing the highest-stakes case of his life&#58; bringing his kidnapped daughter home.</b><br><br> Harry Bosch is assigned a homicide call in South L.A. that takes him to Fortune Liquors, where the Chinese owner has been shot to death behind the counter in an apparent robbery.<br><br>Joined by members of the department's Asian Crime Unit, Bosch relentlessly investigates the killing and soon identifies a suspect, a Los Angeles member of a Hong Kong triad.

But Bane&#8217;s acolyte, Zannah, has yet to engage her Master in mortal combat and prove herself a worthy successor. Determined that the Sith dream of galactic domination will not die with him, Bane vows to learn the secret of a forgotten Dark Lord that will assure the Sith&#8217;s immortality&#8211;and his own.<br><br>A perfect opportunity arises when a Jedi emissary is assassinated on the troubled mining planet Doan, giving Bane an excuse to dispatch his apprentice on a fact-finding mission&#8211;while he himself sets out in secret to capture the ancient holocron of Darth Andeddu and its precious knowledge. But Zannah is no fool. She knows that her ruthless Master has begun to doubt her, and she senses that he is hiding something crucial to her future. If she is going to claim the power she craves, she must take action now. <br><br>While Bane storms the remote stronghold of a fanatical Sith cult, Zannah prepares for her Master&#8217;s downfall by choosing an apprentice of her own&#58; a rogue Jedi cunning and cold-blooded enough to embrace the Sith way and to stand beside her when she at last wrests from Bane the mantle of Dark Lord of the Sith. <br><br>But Zannah is not the only one with the desire and power to destroy Darth Bane. Princess Serra of the Doan royal family is haunted by memories of the monstrous Sith soldier who murdered her father and tortured her when she was a child.

So when Bane suddenly vanishes, Zannah must find him&#8211;possibly even rescue him&#8211;before she can kill him. And so she pursues her quarry from the grim depths of a ravaged world on the brink of catastrophe to the barren reaches of a desert outpost, where the future of the dark side&#8217;s most powerful disciples will be decided, once and for all, by the final, fatal stroke of a lightsaber.","Price":7.99,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":106,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/Qmd2r8MLEjHCPfD8XDDJv7ZRhoiVnccepP8d8DpMcUQgCX","PictureSmallUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmTkPPwvK6WrpawvEycUCyHmRYeudzp8yYQwAxpn52U6BZ","PictureMediumUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/Qmd2r8MLEjHCPfD8XDDJv7ZRhoiVnccepP8d8DpMcUQgCX","PictureLargeUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/Qmd2r8MLEjHCPfD8XDDJv7ZRhoiVnccepP8d8DpMcUQgCX","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"September 28, 2010\",\"Author\":\"Drew Karpyshyn\",\"Publisher\":\"LucasBooks\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"352\",\"Subject Time\":\"\",\"Subject\":\"star wars\",\"Age Min\":\"\",\"Age Max\":\"\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"FIC028030\"}","Rank":143,"Height":173,"Width":105,"Depth":22,"Weight":0,"Id":143},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780060883287","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"One hundred years of solitude","Description":"Probably Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's finest and most famous work. <I>One Hundred Years of Solitude</I> tells the story of the rise and fall, birth and death of a mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buend&iacute;a family.

They never saw her again. Her abduction was one of the most notorious episodes of the vicious conflict known as The Troubles. Everyone in the neighborhood knew the I.R.A. was responsible. But in a climate of fear and paranoia, no one would speak of it. In 2003, five years after an accord brought an uneasy peace to Northern Ireland, a set of human bones was discovered on a beach. McConville's children knew it was their mother when they were told a blue safety pin was attached to the dress&#151;with so many kids, she had always kept it handy for diapers or ripped clothes.<br><br>Patrick Radden Keefe's mesmerizing book on the bitter conflict in Northern Ireland and its aftermath uses the McConville case as a starting point for the tale of a society wracked by a violent guerrilla war, a war whose consequences have never been reckoned with. The brutal violence seared not only people like the McConville children, but also I.R.A. members embittered by a peace that fell far short of the goal of a united Ireland, and left them wondering whether the killings they committed were not justified acts of war, but simple murders. From radical and impetuous I.R.A. terrorists such as Dolours Price, who, when she was barely out of her teens, was already planting bombs in London and targeting informers for execution, to the ferocious I.R.A. mastermind known as The Dark, to the spy games and dirty schemes of the British Army, to Gerry Adams, who negotiated the peace but betrayed his hardcore comrades by denying his I.R.A. past&#151;<i>Say Nothing</i> conjures a world of passion, betrayal, vengeance, and anguish.","Price":14.99,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":117,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmRsDhmaN7SQ6n4aq4wPaqGzS4PHZ7gzCJdxqz1RxHLdcw","PictureSmallUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmbJHXhqADrHJMvJDVntZo15SFSNUYrAbpmTpciKUo3U1E","PictureMediumUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmRsDhmaN7SQ6n4aq4wPaqGzS4PHZ7gzCJdxqz1RxHLdcw","PictureLargeUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmQZsBqmMU2M26gecw73MSVL63MWYyu2MsoKJN2eu83jzd","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"2019\",\"Author\":\"Patrick Radden Keefe\",\"Publisher\":\"Doubleday\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"464\",\"Subject Time\":\"December 1972\",\"Subject\":\"European World History\",\"Age Min\":\"\",\"Age Max\":\"\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"TRU002000\"}","Rank":156,"Height":0,"Width":0,"Depth":0,"Weight":0,"Id":156},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780307808202","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"His Dark Materials Omnibus","Description":"FOR THE FIRST time, all three books of Philip Pullman's award-winning His Dark Materials trilogy (<i>The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, </i>and <i>The Amber Spyglass</i>) will be published in their entirety in one volume.

Meredith, an investment banker, has achieved partnership in one of Wall Street's top firms. Steve, a gifted physician, chose an urban trauma ward over the big money he could have earned elsewhere. The only thing missing in their lives is children. Steve longs for them. But Meredith keeps putting motherhood off, saying she isn't ready and doesn't have time. Not yet. Especially now that she has been offered an extraordinary opportunity, a chance to reach for the brass-ring in San Francisco, three thousand miles away. Meredith is thrilled and surprised when Steve urges her to accept a top position at an exciting young high-tech company. Traditionally, men's careers force families to move to new cities, compelling their wives to abandon their friends, homes, and lives to follow. But Steve is more than willing to uproot himself, saying he'll join her as soon as he can find a new job himself. Perhaps in California, he hopes, they can begin their family at last.<br><br>Neither Steve nor Meredith had reckoned on the frustrations of a bi-coastal marriage, as Steve's job keeps him in New York for months longer than planned. Weekends together, their lifeline, fall prey to their hectic schedules. Alone in San Francisco, Meredith is spending long hours at the office with her boss, charismatic entrepreneur Callan Dow.

A middle school provided showers, as well as access to computers, email, and televisions, allowing the passengers to stay in touch with family and follow the news.</p><p>Over the course of those four days, many of the passengers developed friendships with Gander residents that they expect to last a lifetime.

Painting surprising portraits of Lincoln and other presidents, including Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and Lyndon B. Johnson, and illuminating the courage of such influential citizen activists as Martin Luther King, Jr., early suffragettes Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt, civil rights pioneers Rosa Parks and John Lewis, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Army-McCarthy hearings lawyer Joseph N. Welch, Meacham brings vividly to life turning points in American history. He writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the birth of the Lost Cause; the backlash against immigrants in the First World War and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s; the fight for women&rsquo;s rights; the demagoguery of Huey Long and Father Coughlin and the isolationist work of America First in the years before World War II; the anti-Communist witch-hunts led by Senator Joseph McCarthy; and Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s crusade against Jim Crow.

Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea&#58; the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a <i>fixed mindset</i>&mdash;those who believe that abilities are fixed&mdash;are less likely to flourish than those with a <i>growth mindset</i>&mdash;those who believe that abilities can be developed. <i>Mindset</i> reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.<br><br> In this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love&mdash;to transform their lives and your own.<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Mindset</i></b><br><br>&ldquo;A good book is one whose advice you believe.

The decline of this group, a demographic of our country that has been slowly disintegrating over forty years, has been reported on with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck.The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.'s grandparents were \"dirt poor and in love,\" and moved north from Kentucky's Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually their grandchild (the author) would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of their success in achieving generational upward mobility.But as the family saga of Hillbilly Elegy plays out, we learn that this is only the short, superficial version. Vance's grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother, struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, and were never able to fully escape the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. Vance piercingly shows how he himself still carries around the demons of their chaotic family history.A deeply moving memoir with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, Hillbilly Elegy is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.","Price":16.99,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":188,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmSBSPZtbkYa78bk3ZWkeJzWZsTFt6hfWpTYMUVyr8EqMe","PictureSmallUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/Qmb2uUKiySrsbg8iLoWX5HqbJrVCLmu58cQX4BSvuwHASF","PictureMediumUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmSBSPZtbkYa78bk3ZWkeJzWZsTFt6hfWpTYMUVyr8EqMe","PictureLargeUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmeqYR8Qzt1wERnKJvnGSGgFz3pL4EHKiNqBGwc71iuvU6","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"May 01, 2018\",\"Author\":\"J.

It has been boarded up for decades, but now the new owner has made an incredible discovery&#58; the belongings of Japanese families, left when they were rounded up and sent to internment camps during World War II. As Henry looks on, the owner opens a Japanese parasol.<br><br> This simple act takes old Henry Lee back to the 1940s, at the height of the war, when young Henry&rsquo;s world is a jumble of confusion and excitement, and to his father, who is obsessed with the war in China and having Henry grow up American. While &ldquo;scholarshipping&rdquo; at the exclusive Rainier Elementary, where the white kids ignore him, Henry meets Keiko Okabe, a young Japanese American student. Amid the chaos of blackouts, curfews, and FBI raids, Henry and Keiko forge a bond of friendship&ndash;and innocent love&ndash;that transcends the long-standing prejudices of their Old World ancestors. And after Keiko and her family are swept up in the evacuations to the internment camps, she and Henry are left only with the hope that the war will end, and that their promise to each other will be kept.<br><br> Forty years later, Henry Lee is certain that the parasol belonged to Keiko. In the hotel&rsquo;s dark dusty basement he begins looking for signs of the Okabe family&rsquo;s belongings and for a long-lost object whose value he cannot begin to measure. Now a widower, Henry is still trying to find his voice&ndash;words that might explain the actions of his nationalistic father; words that might bridge the gap between him and his modern, Chinese American son; words that might help him confront the choices he made many years ago. <br><br> Set during one of the most conflicted and volatile times in American history, <b>Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet</b> is an extraordinary story of commitment and enduring hope.

My autoimmune disease is gone and I'm&#160;37 pounds lighter in my pleather.\" &#151;Kelly Clarkson</p><P>Most of us have heard of gluten&#8212;a protein found in wheat that causes widespread inflammation in the body. Americans spend billions of dollars on gluten-free diets in an effort to protect their health. But what if we&#8217;ve been missing the root of the problem? In <i>The Plant Paradox</i>, renowned cardiologist Dr. Steven Gundry reveals that gluten is just one variety of a common, and highly toxic, plant-based protein called lectin. Lectins are found not only in grains like wheat but also in the &#8220;gluten-free&#8221; foods most of us commonly regard as healthy, including many fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, and conventional dairy products. These proteins, which are found in the seeds, grains, skins, rinds, and leaves of plants, are designed by nature to protect them from predators (including humans). Once ingested, they incite a kind of chemical warfare in our bodies, causing inflammatory reactions that can lead to weight gain and serious health conditions.</p><P>At his waitlist-only clinics in California, Dr. Gundry has successfully treated tens of thousands of patients suffering from autoimmune disorders, diabetes, leaky gut syndrome, heart disease, and neurodegenerative diseases with a protocol that detoxes the cells, repairs the gut, and nourishes the body. Now, in <i>The Plant Paradox</i>, he shares this clinically proven program with readers around the world.</p><P>The simple (and daunting) fact is, lectins are everywhere. Thankfully, Dr. Gundry offers simple hacks we easily can employ to avoid them, including&#58;</p><ul><li>Peel your veggies. Most of the lectins are contained in the skin and seeds of plants; simply peeling and de-seeding vegetables (like tomatoes and peppers) reduces their lectin content.</li><li>Shop for fruit in season. Fruit contain fewer lectins when ripe, so eating apples, berries, and other lectin-containing fruits at the peak of ripeness helps minimize your lectin consumption.</li><li>Swap your brown rice for white. Whole grains and seeds with hard outer coatings are designed by nature to cause digestive distress&#8212;and are full of lectins.</li></ul><P>With a full list of lectin-containing foods and simple substitutes for each, a step-by-step detox and eating plan, and delicious lectin-free recipes, <i>The Plant Paradox</i> illuminates the hidden dangers lurking in your salad bowl&#8212;and shows you how to eat whole foods in a whole new way.</p>","Price":29.99,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":205,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmTAB2S4SdLa45ngJmPBL42cY2jByeBHGaJ5TJXRBbCS8U","PictureSmallUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmTXZaA5oCvqiPGPaGXFzUcWDZRj3UGpTqbGLNtKnagFaN","PictureMediumUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmTAB2S4SdLa45ngJmPBL42cY2jByeBHGaJ5TJXRBbCS8U","PictureLargeUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmVKejcg2Hjjs42PgsC416RKxyUzj8MQT1s7th7p22yndY","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"Apr 25, 2017\",\"Author\":\"Dr. Steven R Gundry M.D.\",\"Publisher\":\"Harper Wave\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"416\",\"Subject Time\":\"\",\"Subject\":\"Plants\",\"Age Min\":\"\",\"Age Max\":\"\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"582.13\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"HEA017000\"}","Rank":322,"Height":228,"Width":152,"Depth":35,"Weight":0,"Id":322},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780062797629","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"Kill the Queen (A Crown of Shards Novel Book 1)","Description":"<P><i>Gladiator</i> meets <i>Game of Thrones</i>&#58; a royal woman becomes a skilled warrior to destroy her murderous cousin, avenge her family, and save her kingdom in this first entry in a dazzling fantasy epic from the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author of the Elemental Assassin series&#8212;an enthralling tale that combines magic, murder, intrigue, adventure, and a hint of romance.</p><P>In a realm where one&#8217;s magical power determines one&#8217;s worth, Lady Everleigh&#8217;s lack of obvious ability relegates her to the shadows of the royal court of Bellona, a kingdom steeped in gladiator tradition.

Being forced to abandon the young victim tormented Milo. But his fears prevented him from pursuing the truth, and over the years he managed to forget.

Using the threads of all of our best stories, Yann Martel has woven a glorious spiritual adventure that makes us question what it means to be alive, and to believe.<br>Growing up in Pondicherry, India, Piscine Molitor Patel -- known as Pi -- has a rich life. Bookish by nature, young Pi acquires a broad knowledge of not only the great religious texts but of all literature, and has a great curiosity about how the world works. His family runs the local zoo, and he spends many of his days among goats, hippos, swans, and bears, developing his own theories about the nature of animals and how human nature conforms to it. Pi&#8217;s family life is quite happy, even though his brother picks on him and his parents aren&#8217;t quite sure how to accept his decision to simultaneously embrace and practise three religions -- Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam.<br>But despite the lush and nurturing variety of Pi&#8217;s world, there are broad political changes afoot in India, and when Pi is sixteen his parents decide that the family needs to escape to a better life. Choosing to move to Canada, they close the zoo, pack their belongings, and board a Japanese cargo ship called the <i>Tsimtsum</i>. Travelling with them are many of their animals, bound for zoos in North America. However, they have only just begun their journey when the ship sinks, taking the dreams of the Patel family down with it. Only Pi survives, cast adrift in a lifeboat with the unlikeliest oftravelling companions: a zebra, an orang-utan, a hyena, and a 450-pound Royal Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.<br>Thus begins Pi Patel&#8217;s epic, 227-day voyage across the Pacific, and the powerful story of faith and survival at the heart of <i>Life of Pi</i>. Worn and scared, oscillating between hope and despair, Pi is witness to the playing out of the food chain, quite aware of his new position within it. When only the tiger is left of the seafaring menagerie, Pi realizes that his survival depends on his ability to assert his own will, and sets upon a grand and ordered scheme to keep from being Richard Parker&#8217;s next meal.<br>As the days pass, Pi fights both boredom and terror by throwing himself into the practical details of surviving on the open sea -- catching fish, collecting rain water, protecting himself from the sun -- all the while ensuring that the tiger is also kept alive, and knows that Pi is the key to his survival. The castaways face gruelling pain in their brushes with starvation, illness, and the storms that lash the small boat, but there is also the solace of beauty: the rainbow hues of a dorado&#8217;s death-throes, the peaceful eye of a looming whale, the shimmering blues of the ocean&#8217;s swells. Hope is fleeting, however, and despite adapting his religious practices to his daily routine, Pi feels the constant, pressing weight of despair. It is during the most hopeless and gruelling days of his voyage that Pi whittles to the core of his beliefs, casts off his own assumptions, and faces his underlying terrors head-on.<br>As Yann Martel has said in one interview, &#8220;The theme of this novel can be summarized in three lines. Life is a story. You can choose your story. And a story with an imaginative overlay is the better story.&#8221; And for Martel, the greatest imaginative overlay is religion. &#8220;God is a shorthand for anything that is beyond the material -- any greater pattern of meaning.&#8221; In <i>Life of Pi</i>, the question of stories, and of what stories to believe, is front and centre from the beginning, when the author tells us how he was led to Pi Patel and to this novel: in an Indian coffee house, a gentleman told him, &#8220;I have a story that will make you believe in God.&#8221; And as this novel comes to its brilliant conclusion, Pi shows us that the story with the imaginative overlay is also the story that contains the most truth. <P>Author Biography&#58; Yann Martel was born in Spain in 1963 of peripatetic Canadian parents. He grew up in Alaska, British Columbia, Costa Rica, France, Ontario and Mexico, and has continued travelling as an adult, spending time in Iran, Turkey and India. Martel refers to his travels as, &#8220;seeing the same play on a whole lot of different stages.&#8221;<br>After studying philosophy at Trent University and while doing various odd jobs -- tree planting, dishwashing, working as a security guard -- he began to write. In addition to <i>Life of Pi</i>, Martel is the prize-winning author of <i>The Facts Behind the Helsinki Roccamatios</i><i>,</i> a collection of short stories, and of <i>Self</i>, a novel, both published internationally. Yann has been living from his writing since the age of 27. He divides his time between yoga, writing and volunteering in a palliative care unit.

The only thing missing in their lives is children. Steve longs for them. But Meredith keeps putting motherhood off, saying she isn't ready and doesn't have time. Not yet. Especially now that she has been offered an extraordinary opportunity, a chance to reach for the brass-ring in San Francisco, three thousand miles away. Meredith is thrilled and surprised when Steve urges her to accept a top position at an exciting young high-tech company.

Painting surprising portraits of Lincoln and other presidents, including Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and Lyndon B. Johnson, and illuminating the courage of such influential citizen activists as Martin Luther King, Jr., early suffragettes Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt, civil rights pioneers Rosa Parks and John Lewis, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Army-McCarthy hearings lawyer Joseph N. Welch, Meacham brings vividly to life turning points in American history. He writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the birth of the Lost Cause; the backlash against immigrants in the First World War and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s; the fight for women&rsquo;s rights; the demagoguery of Huey Long and Father Coughlin and the isolationist work of America First in the years before World War II; the anti-Communist witch-hunts led by Senator Joseph McCarthy; and Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s crusade against Jim Crow. Each of these dramatic hours in our national life have been shaped by the contest to lead the country to look forward rather than back, to assert hope over fear&mdash;a struggle that continues even now.<br><br>While the American story has not always&mdash;or even often&mdash;been heroic, we have been sustained by a belief in progress even in the gloomiest of times.

This is must-read material if you want to understand what the Trump administration is still up to right now.\" &#151;Lawrence O'Donnell</b><br><br>There are questions that the Mueller report couldn't&mdash;or wouldn't&mdash;answer. What actually happened to instigate the Russia investigation? Did President Trump&rsquo;s meddling incriminate him? There&rsquo;s no mystery to what Trump thinks. He claims that the Deep State, a cabal of career bureaucrats&mdash;among them, Andrew McCabe, Lisa Page, and Peter Strzok, previously little known figures within the FBI whom he has obsessively and publically reviled&mdash;is concerned only with protecting its own power and undermining the democratic process. Conversely, James Comey has defended the FBI as incorruptible apolitical public servants who work tirelessly to uphold the rule of law. <br> &#160;<br> For the first time, bestselling author James B. Stewart sifts these conflicting accounts to present a clear-eyed view of what exactly happened inside the FBI in the lead-up to the 2016 election, drawing on scores of interviews with key FBI, Department of Justice, and White House officialsand voluminous transcripts, notes, and internal reports. In full detail, this is the dramatic saga of the FBI&rsquo;s simultaneous investigations of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump&mdash;the first time in American history the FBI has been thrust into the middle of both parties' campaigns for the presidency. Stewart shows what exactly was set in motion when Trump fired Comey, triggering the appointment of Robert Mueller as an independent special counsel and causing the FBI to open a formal investigation into the president himself. And how this unprecedented event joined in ongoing combat two vital institutions of American democracy&#58; the presidency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.&#160;<br> &#160;<br> At stake in this epic battle is the rule of law itself, the foundation of the U.S. Constitution. There is no room for compromise, but plenty for collateral damage. The reputations of both sides have already been harmed, perhaps irrevocably, and at great cost to American democracy. <i>Deep State</i> goes beyond the limits of the legally constrained Mueller report, showing how the president&rsquo;s obsession with the idea of a conspiracy against him is still upending lives and sending shockwaves through both the FBI and the Department of Justice. In this world-historical struggle&mdash;Trump versus intelligence agencies&mdash;Stewart shows us in rare style what&rsquo;s real and what matters now.

John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Dahmer. The names of notorious serial killers are usually well-known; they echo in the news and in public consciousness. But most people have never heard of Israel Keyes, one of the most ambitious and terrifying serial killers in modern history. The FBI considered his behavior unprecedented. Described by a prosecutor as \"a force of pure evil,\" Keyes was a predator who struck all over the United States. He buried \"kill kits\"&#151;cash, weapons, and body-disposal tools&#151;in remote locations across the country. Over the course of fourteen years, Keyes would fly to a city, rent a car, and drive thousands of miles in order to use his kits. He would break into a stranger's house, abduct his victims in broad daylight, and kill and dispose of them in mere hours. And then he would return home to Alaska, resuming life as a quiet, reliable construction worker devoted to his only daughter.<br><br>When journalist Maureen Callahan first heard about Israel Keyes in 2012, she was captivated by how a killer of this magnitude could go undetected by law enforcement for over a decade. And so began a project that consumed her for the next several years&#151;uncovering the true story behind how the FBI ultimately caught Israel Keyes, and trying to understand what it means for a killer like Keyes to exist. A killer who left a path of monstrous, randomly committed crimes in his wake&#151;many of which remain unsolved to this day.<br><br><i>American Predator </i>is the ambitious culmination of years of interviews with key figures in law enforcement and in Keyes's life, and research uncovered from classified FBI files.

Three men who never would have met are becoming friends...and each man finds himself changing in surprising ways, Coop most of all. Because beneath the dazzle and flash, the impeccably tailored suits and the sheer bravado, is a man trying to keep control of his carefully ordered world&#8211;a world that is becoming more and more unpredictable with each passing day. <br><br>First, a tabloid scandal erupts, threatening Coop&#8217;s budding romance with a wealthy debutante. . .A stranger approaches Coop with stunning news....A devastating accident almost claims the life of one of the housemates....And in the midst of it all, <i>The Cottage</i> welcomes a new houseguest with a secret of her own, who will change Coop&#8217;s life in unexpected ways.  Because among the people who share his cottage and his life, Coop Winslow&#8211;loner, bachelor, movie star&#8211;may find the rarest of all opportunities&#58; a chance to build a happiness he could never have dreamed of on his own, and to become the kind of human being he has never been. <br><br>Against a glittering backdrop of celebrity and glamour, Danielle Steel digs deeper to tell a story of friendship and love, tragedy and second chances...of the choices and unexpected turns of fate that can shape characters and lives.","Price":7.99,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":6,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"","PictureSmallUri":"","PictureMediumUri":"","PictureLargeUri":"","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"2009\",\"Author\":\"Danielle Steel\",\"Publisher\":\"Random House Publishing Group\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"\",\"Subject Time\":\"\",\"Subject\":\"Fiction\",\"Age Min\":\"\",\"Age Max\":\"\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"813/.54\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"FIC044000\"}","Rank":430,"Height":0,"Width":0,"Depth":0,"Weight":0,"Id":430},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780440337942","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"Fractured","Description":"<P>&#8220;Breathless tension!&#8221; raved the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>. &#8220;One of [the year&#8217;s] most remarkable achievements,&#8221; crowed the<i> Philadelphia Inquirer</i>.

It could also endanger her life.<P><B>A Note from the Author:</B><P>The story behind <i>The Hate U Give</i> by Angie Thomas<br><br>I remember the first time I saw Emmett Louis Till.<br>I couldn&rsquo;t have been more than eight years old. I came across his photo in a Jet magazine that marked the anniversary of his death. At the time, I was convinced he wasn&rsquo;t real, or at least that he wasn&rsquo;t a person. What was supposed to be a face was mutilated beyond recognition. He looked more like a prop from a movie to me; a monster from some over-the-top horror flick.<br>But he was a person, a boy, and his story was a cautionary tale, even for a black girl in Mississippi who was born more than three decades after he died. &ldquo;Know your worth,&rdquo; my mom would say, &ldquo;but also know that not everyone values you as much as I do.&rdquo;<br>Still, Emmett wasn&rsquo;t real to me. There was no way I&rsquo;d ever have to worry about anything like that happening to me or to someone I knew. Things had changed, even in Mississippi. That was history. The present had its own problems<br>I grew up in a neighborhood that&rsquo;s notorious for all the wrong reasons. Drug dealers, shootings, crime, insert other &ldquo;ghetto&rdquo; stereotypes here. While everything they showed on the news was true, there was so much more that you wouldn&rsquo;t see unless you lived there.  It was my home. My neighbors were family. The neighborhood drug dealer was a superhero who gave kids money for snacks and beat up pedophiles who tried to snatch little girls off the street. The cops could be superheroes too, but I was taught at a young age to be &ldquo;mindful&rdquo; around them. So had my friends. We&rsquo;d all heard stories, and though they didn&rsquo;t come with mutilated photos, they were realer than Emmett. <br><br>I remember the first time I saw the video of Oscar Grant.<br>I was a transfer student in my first year at the college I&rsquo;d later graduate from. It was in a nicer part of town than where I lived, but only ten minutes away from it, and it was very, very white. A majority of the time, I was the only black student in my creative writing classes. I did everything I could so no one would label me as the &ldquo;black girl from the hood.&rdquo; I would leave home, blasting Tupac, but by the time I arrived to pick up a friend, I was listening to the Jonas Brothers. I kept quiet whenever race came up in discussions, despite the glances I&rsquo;d get because as the &ldquo;token black girl,&rdquo; I was expected to speak. <br>But Oscar did something to me. Suddenly, Emmett wasn&rsquo;t history. Emmett was still reality.  <br>The video was shocking for multiple reasons, one being that someone actually caught it on tape. This was undeniable evidence that had never been provided for the stories I&rsquo;d heard. Yet my classmates, who had never heard such tales, had their own opinions about it.<br>&ldquo;He should&rsquo;ve just done what they said.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He was resisting.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I heard he was an ex-con and a drug dealer.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He had it coming. Why are people so mad?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They were just doing their job.&rdquo;<br>And I hate to admit it, but I still remained silent.<br>I was hurt, no doubt. And angry. Frustrated. Straight-up pissed. I knew plenty of Oscars. I grew up with them and I was friends with them. This was like being told that they deserved to die. <br>As the unrest took place in Oakland, I wondered how my community would react if that happened to one of our Oscars. I also wondered if my classmates would make the same comments if I became an Oscar. I wasn&rsquo;t an ex-con or a drug dealer, but I was from a neighborhood they were afraid to visit, the same neighborhood they once jokingly said was full of criminals, not knowing that&rsquo;s where I lived until months later. <br>From all of those questions and emotions, <i>The Hate U Give</i> was born.<br>I&rsquo;ve always told stories. When I can&rsquo;t find a way to say the words out loud, I create characters who do it for me. <i>The Hate U Give</i> started as a short story my senior year. It was cathartic at the time, and I thought I was done telling Starr and Khalil&rsquo;s story because I foolishly hoped Oscar wouldn&rsquo;t happen again.<br>But then there was Trayvon. Michael. Eric. Tamir.<br>And there was more anger, frustration, and hurt for me, my peers, and the kids in my neighborhood who saw themselves in those gentlemen. So I expressed those feelings the best way I knew how, through story, in hopes that I would give a voice to every kid who feels the same way I do and is not sure how to express it. <br>But my ultimate hope is that everyone who reads this book, no matter their experiences, walks away from it understanding those feelings and sharing them in some way.<br>And maybe then, Emmett Louis Till can truly become history. <br>","Price":11.99,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":12,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmVxcUaatPMpcxE6rF1EskHf2XRWKw6FnupxWChDJveLtw","PictureSmallUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmRDZ3FmJRPQg1KqSotXorLwJ7HZCmWv37VyWmG6RPWSaB","PictureMediumUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmVxcUaatPMpcxE6rF1EskHf2XRWKw6FnupxWChDJveLtw","PictureLargeUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmSrottMQG1BJPk4XNYCkCYMjBX9ywHfLXG44RpGzYRCMU","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"2017\",\"Author\":\"Angie Thomas\",\"Publisher\":\"Balzer + Bray\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"\",\"Subject Time\":\"\",\"Subject\":\"young adult\",\"Age Min\":\"14\",\"Age Max\":\"17\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"YAF046120\"}","Rank":480,"Height":0,"Width":0,"Depth":0,"Weight":0,"Id":480},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780307957832","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"The golden compass","Description":"<b><b><i>HIS DARK MATERIALS </i>IS NOW AN HBO ORIGINAL SERIES STARRING DAFNE KEEN, RUTH WILSON, JAMES McAVOY, AND LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA!</b><br><br>The only hardcover omnibus of the best-selling and award-winning fantasy trilogy.</b><br><br> Philip Pullman's trilogy is a masterpiece that transcends genre and appeals to readers of all ages. His heroine, Lyra, is an orphan living in a parallel universe in which science, theology, and magic are entwined. The epic story that takes us through the three novels is not only a spellbinding adventure featuring armored polar bears, magical devices, witches, and daemons, it is also an audacious and profound reimagining of Milton's <i>Paradise Lost </i>that has already inspired a number of serious books of literary criticism.

Hundreds of police officers were required to protect his speech. What was so frightening about Shapiro? He came to argue that Western civilization is in the midst of a crisis of purpose and ideas; that we have let grievances replace our sense of community and political expediency limit our individual rights; that we are teaching our kids that their emotions matter more than rational debate; and that the only meaning in life is arbitrary and subjective.</p><p>As a society, we are forgetting that almost everything great that has ever happened in history happened because of people who believed in both Judeo-Christian values and in the Greek-born power of reason.

Larry Page and Sergey Brin had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy, and sky-high ambitions, but no real business plan. For Google to change the world (or even to survive), Page and Brin had to learn how to make tough choices on priorities while keeping their team on track. They'd have to know when to pull the plug on losing propositions, to fail fast. And they needed timely, relevant data to track their progress&mdash;to measure what mattered.<br><br>Doerr taught them about a proven approach to operating excellence&#58; Objectives and Key Results. He had first discovered OKRs in the 1970s as an engineer at Intel, where the legendary Andy Grove (\"the greatest manager of his or any era\") drove the best-run company Doerr had ever seen. Later, as a venture capitalist, Doerr shared Grove's brainchild with more than fifty companies. Wherever the process was faithfully practiced, it worked.<br><br>In this goal-setting system, objectives define what we seek to achieve; key results are how those top-priority goals will be attained with specific, measurable actions within a set time frame. Everyone's goals, from entry level to CEO, are transparent to the entire organization. <br><br>The benefits are profound. OKRs surface an organization's most important work. They focus effort and foster coordination. They keep employees on track. They link objectives across silos to unify and strengthen the entire company. Along the way, OKRs enhance workplace satisfaction and boost retention.<br><br>In <i>Measure What Matters</i>, Doerr shares a broad range of first-person, behind-the-scenes case studies, with narrators including Bono and Bill Gates, to demonstrate the focus, agility, and explosive growth that OKRs have spurred at so many great organizations. This book will help a new generation of leaders capture the same magic.","Price":27.0,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":22,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"","PictureSmallUri":"","PictureMediumUri":"","PictureLargeUri":"","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"2018\",\"Author\":\"\",\"Publisher\":\"Portfolio\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"320\",\"Subject Time\":\"\",\"Subject\":\"Business planning\",\"Age Min\":\"\",\"Age Max\":\"\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"BUS041000\"}","Rank":571,"Height":218,"Width":144,"Depth":25,"Weight":0,"Id":571},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780345509901","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"Tears of the Desert","Description":"<P><b>&ldquo;[Halima Bashir&rsquo;s] mesmerizing tale of against-all-odds endurance is a piercing lament&mdash;and a clear-eyed call to action.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Vogue</i></b><br>&#160;<br><b>&ldquo;This memoir helps keep the Darfur tragedy open as a wound not yet healed.&rdquo;&mdash;Elie Wiesel, author of&#160;<i>Night</i></b><br>&#160;<br>Born into the Zaghawa tribe in the Sudanese desert, Halima Bashir received a good education away from her rural surroundings (thanks to her doting, politically astute father) and at twenty-four became her village&rsquo;s first formal doctor.

When he rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life, Mitch visited Morrie ever Tuesday, just like in the old days.

The woman he loves is gone, his principles have been irrevocably compromised, and his father, once a paragon of the community that Penn leads as mayor, is about to be tried for the murder of a former lover. Most terrifying of all, Dr. Cage seems bent on self-destruction. Despite Penn's experience as a prosecutor in major murder trials, his father has frozen him out of the trial preparations&#151;preferring to risk dying in prison to revealing the truth of the crime to his son. <P>During forty years practicing medicine, Tom Cage made himself the most respected and beloved physician in Natchez, Mississippi. But this revered Southern figure has secrets known only to himself and a handful of others.&#160; Among them, Tom has a second son, the product of an 1960s affair with his devoted African American nurse, Viola Turner.&#160; It is Viola who has been murdered, and her bitter son&#151;Penn's half-brother&#151;who sets in motion the murder case against his father.&#160; The resulting investigation exhumes dangerous ghosts from Mississippi's violent past. In some way that Penn cannot fathom, Viola Turner was a nexus point between his father and the Double Eagles, a savage splinter cell of the KKK. More troubling still, the long-buried secrets shared by Dr. Cage and the former Klansmen may hold the key to the most devastating assassinations of the 1960s. The surviving Double Eagles will stop at nothing to keep their past crimes buried, and with the help of some of the most influential men in the state, they seek to ensure that Dr. Cage either takes the fall for them, or takes his secrets to an early grave.&#160; <P>Unable to trust anyone around him&#151;not even his own mother&#151;Penn joins forces with Serenity Butler, a famous young black author who has come to Natchez to write about his father's case. Together, Penn and Serenity battle to crack the Double Eagles and discover the secret history of the Cage family and the South itself, a desperate move that risks the only thing they have left to gamble&#58; their lives. <P><i>Mississippi Blood</i> is the enthralling conclusion to a breathtaking trilogy seven years in the making&#151;one that has kept readers on the edge of their seats. With piercing insight, narrative prowess, and a masterful ability to blend history and imagination, Greg Iles illuminates the brutal history of the American South in a highly atmospheric and suspenseful novel that delivers the shocking resolution his fans have eagerly awaited.&#160;<P><P>","Price":28.99,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":365,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"","PictureSmallUri":"","PictureMediumUri":"","PictureLargeUri":"","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"2017\",\"Author\":\"Greg Iles\",\"Publisher\":\"\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"704\",\"Subject Time\":\"\",\"Subject\":\"Penn Cage (Fictitious character)\",\"Age Min\":\"\",\"Age Max\":\"\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"FIC030000\"}","Rank":625,"Height":228,"Width":152,"Depth":41,"Weight":0,"Id":625},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780448456249","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"Kindergarten, here I come!","Description":"<P>Get ready for school with these fun poems! <br><br>This adorable picture book celebrates all the familiar milestones and moments shared by every single kindergartener.

How does one do this? By becoming metahuman. <br><br> To be metahuman, however, isn&rsquo;t science fiction and is certainly not about being a superhero. To be metahuman means to move past the limitation constructed by the mind and enter a new state of awareness where we have deliberate and concrete access to peak experiences that can transform people&rsquo;s lives from the inside out. <br><br>Humans do this naturally&mdash;to a point. For centuries the great artists, scientists, writers, and many so-called ordinary people have gone beyond the everyday physical world. But if we could channel these often bewildering experiences, what would happen? Chopra argues we would wake up to experiences that would blow open your body, mind, and soul. <br><br> <i>Metahuman</i>&#160;invites the reader to walk the path here and now. Waking up, we learn, isn&rsquo;t just about mindfulness or meditation. Waking up, to become metahuman, is to expand our consciousness in all that we think, say, and do.&#160;<br><br>By going beyond, we liberate ourselves from old conditioning and all the mental constructs that underlie anxiety, tension, and ego-driven demands. Waking up allows life to make sense as never before. To make this as practical as possible, Chopra ends the book with a 31-day guide to becoming metahuman. Once you wake up, he writes, life becomes transformed, because pure consciousness&mdash;which is the field of all possibilities&mdash;dawns in your life. Only then does your infinite potential become your personal reality.<br><br><b>Advance praise for </b><i><b>Metahuman</b></i><br><br>&ldquo;Our world is preoccupied with material progress, yet too often we overlook the miracle of our very existence.

In a late-night showdown after a near-fatal car chase, San Francisco police lieutenant Lindsay Boxer has to make an instantaneous decision&#58; in self-defense, she fires her weapon-and sets off a chain of events that leaves a police force disgraced, an entire city divided, and a family destroyed. Now everything she's worked her entire life for hinges on the decision of twelve jurors. To escape scrutiny during breaks from her trial, Lindsay retreats to the picturesque town of Half Moon Bay. But soon after her arrival, a string of grisly murders punches through the peaceful community. There are no witnesses and there is no discernible pattern. But a key detail recalls a case Lindsay worked on as a rookie years before-an unsolved murder that has haunted her ever since. As summer comes into full swing, Lindsay and her friends in the Women's Murder Club battle for her life on two fronts&#58; before a judge and jury as her trial comes to a climax, and facing unknown adversaries who will do anything to keep her from the truth about the killings-including killing again.

With every chapter, you get a history lesson, a hunting lesson, a nature lesson and a cooking lesson. . . . <i>Meat Eater </i>offers an overabundance to savor.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br></b> &#160;<br>Steven Rinella grew up in Twin Lake, Michigan, the son of a hunter who taught his three sons to love the natural world the way he did. As a child, Rinella devoured stories of the American wilderness, especially the exploits of his hero, Daniel Boone. He began fishing at the age of three and shot his first squirrel at eight and his first deer at thirteen. He chose the colleges he went to by their proximity to good hunting ground, and he experimented with living solely off wild meat. As an adult, he feeds his family from the food he hunts.<br> &#160;<br> <i>Meat Eater </i>chronicles Rinella&rsquo;s lifelong relationship with nature and hunting through the lens of ten hunts, beginning when he was an aspiring mountain man at age ten and ending as a thirty-seven-year-old Brooklyn father who hunts in the remotest corners of North America. He tells of having a struggling career as a fur trapper just as fur prices were falling; of a dalliance with catch-and-release steelhead fishing; of canoeing in the Missouri Breaks in search of mule deer just as the Missouri River was freezing up one November; and of hunting the elusive Dall sheep in the glaciated mountains of Alaska. <br> &#160;<br> Through each story, Rinella grapples with themes such as the role of the hunter in shaping America, the vanishing frontier, the ethics of killing, the allure of hunting trophies, the responsibilities that human predators have to their prey, and the disappearance of the hunter himself as Americans lose their connection with the way their food finds its way to their tables. Hunting, he argues, is intimately connected with our humanity; assuming responsibility for acquiring the meat that we eat, rather than entrusting it to proxy executioners, processors, packagers, and distributors, is one of the most respectful and exhilarating things a meat eater can do.<br> &#160;<br> A thrilling storyteller with boundless interesting facts and historical information about the land, the natural world, and the history of hunting, Rinella also includes after each chapter a section of &ldquo;Tasting Notes&rdquo; that draws from his thirty-plus years of eating and cooking wild game, both at home and over a campfire.

Anne's ascent from private gentlewoman to queen was astonishing, but equally compelling was her shockingly swift downfall. Charged with high treason and imprisoned in the Tower of London in May 1536, Anne met her terrible end all the while protesting her innocence. There remains, however, much mystery surrounding the queen's arrest and the events leading up to it&#58; Were charges against her fabricated because she stood in the way of Henry VIII making a third marriage and siring an heir, or was she the victim of a more complex plot fueled by court politics and deadly rivalry?<br><br>&#160;&#160;&#160; <b>The Lady in the Tower </b>examines in engrossing detail the motives and intrigues of those who helped to seal the queen's fate.

And then, suddenly, Tracy Shapiro, the Troubleshooters&rsquo; new receptionist, vanishes while playing the role of hostage during a mock rescue operation.<br><br> Teaming up with the FBI to launch a manhunt in the treacherous wilderness, Jenk and Lindsey must put aside their feelings as a record snowstorm approaches, dramatically reducing any hope of finding Tracy alive. The trail is colder than the biting New England climate until a lucky break leads to a horrifying discovery&ndash; a brutally murdered young woman wearing the jacket Tracy wore when she disappeared. Suddenly there is a chilling certainty that Tracy has fallen prey to a serial killer&ndash; one who knows the backwoods terrain and who doesn&rsquo;t play by the rules of engagement.<br><br> In a race against time, a raging blizzard, and a cunning opponent, Jenk and Lindsey are put to the ultimate test. Rising everything, they must finally come together in a desperate attempt to save Tracy&ndash;and each other.","Price":7.99,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":388,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmRGqUDjUgBjShp3z5QEjdSHvrY71djEgy5rGscBZiREyd","PictureSmallUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmRnhVFKQyVFTSzD4QHGFbk1U2XvFfM63ssKn74yisa2f5","PictureMediumUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmRGqUDjUgBjShp3z5QEjdSHvrY71djEgy5rGscBZiREyd","PictureLargeUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmWKDToFY84kZ5o7P36ZQeRLpVQNKsR8AKGkST6rRw5YkD","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"2006\",\"Author\":\"Suzanne Brockmann\",\"Publisher\":\"Random House Publishing Group\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"\",\"Subject Time\":\"\",\"Subject\":\"Internet Archive Wishlist\",\"Age Min\":\"\",\"Age Max\":\"\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"FIC027000\"}","Rank":674,"Height":0,"Width":0,"Depth":0,"Weight":0,"Id":674},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780142427552","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"Prodigy","Description":"<P><b>The second book in Marie Lu&rsquo;s&#160;<i>New York Time</i>s bestselling LEGEND trilogy&mdash;perfect for fans of THE HUNGER GAMES and DIVERGENT!</b><br><br>June and Day arrive in Vegas just as the unthinkable happens&#58; the Elector Primo dies, and his son Anden takes his place.

Leningrad, 1941&#58; The European war seems far away in this city of fallen grandeur, where splendid palaces and stately boulevards speak of a different age, when the city was known as St. Petersburg. Now two sisters, Tatiana and Dasha Metanov, live in a cramped apartment, sharing one room with their brother and parents. Such are the harsh realities of Stalin's Russia, but when Hitler invades the country, the siege of its cities makes the previous severe conditions seem luxurious.<P>Against this backdrop of danger and uncertainty, Tatiana meets Alexander, an officer in the Red Army whose self-confidence sets him apart from most Russian men and helps to conceal a mysterious and troubled past.<P>Once the relentless winter and the German army's blockade take hold of the city, the Metanovs are forced into ever more desperate measures to survive. With bombs falling and food becoming scarce, Tatiana and Alexander are drawn to each other in an impossible love that threatens to tear her family apart and reveal his dangerous secret &#151; a secret as destructive as the war itself.

This is the life of M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e, the heaviest drinking, hardest fighting, most oversexed and arrogant band in the world. Their unbelievable exploits are the stuff of rock 'n' roll legend. They nailed the hottest chicks, started the bloodiest fights, partied with the biggest drug dealers, and got to know the inside of every jail cell from California to Japan. They have dedicated an entire career to living life to its extreme, from the greatest fantasies to the darkest tragedies. Tommy married two international sex symbols; Vince killed a man and lost a daughter to cancer; Nikki overdosed, rose from the dead, and then OD'd again the next day; and Wick shot a woman and tried to hang his own brother. But that's just the beginning. Fueled by every drug they could get their hands on and obscene amounts of alcohol, driven by fury and headed straight for hell, M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e raged through two decades, leaving behind a trail of debauched women, trashed hotel rooms, crashed cars, psychotic managers, and broken bones that has left the music industry cringing to this day. All these unspeakable acts, not to mention their dire consequences, are laid bare in <I>The Dirt.</I><P>Here &#151; directly from Nikki, Vince, Tommy, and Mick &#151; is the unexpurgated version of the whole glorious, gut-wrenching story. In these pages, published for the first time anywhere, are Tommy Lee's letters to Pamela Anderson from prison&#58; Mick's confession to having an incurable disease that is slowly killing him; Vince's experience burying his own daughter &#151; and the train wreck that his lifebecame afterward; and Nikki's anguished struggle to deal with an entire life fueled by anger over his childhood abandonment, his discovery of the family he never knew he had &#151; and his subsequent loss of them. And all of it accompanied by scores of rare, never-before-published photographs, mug shots, and handwritten lyrics. No one is spared. Not David Lee Roth, Ozzy Osbourne, Vanity, Aerosmith, Heather Locklear, AC/DC, Lita Ford, Iron Maiden, Pamela Anderson, Guns N' Roses, Donna D'Errico, RATT, or those two girls from Dallas, Texas.<P>Make no mistake about it&#58; these guys are geniuses.

The daughter of German immigrants, she grew up poor in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, the very world she re-creates with such meticulous detail in <I>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.</I>After marrying fellow Brooklynite George H.E. Smith, she moved with him to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he was a law student at the University of Michigan. The young bride soon had two daughters, Nancy and Mary, and was forced to wait until the girls had entered grade school before endeavoring to complete her own formal education.Although she had not finished high school, the largely autodidactic Smith was permitted to take classes at the university, and she concentrated her studies there in journalism, drama, writing and literature. She capped her education by winning the Avery Hopkins Award for work in drama, and did a three-year course in playwriting at the Yale Drama School.After stints writing features for a Detroit newspaper, reading plays for the Federal Theatre Project, and acting in summer stock, Smith landed in Chapel Hill, North Carolina under the auspices of the W.P.A. She and her first husband divorced in 1938. In 1943, she married JoeJones, a writer, journalist, and associate editor of the <I>Chapel Hill Weekly,</I> while he was serving as a private in the wartime army. That same year, <I>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,</I> her first novel, was published.The prestige of writing a best-selling, critically lauded book brought assignments from the <I>New York Times Magazine,</I> for which she wrote both light-hearted and serious commentary. In a December 1943 piece called \"Why Brooklyn is that Way,\" Smith donned the mantle of her childhood borough's unofficial champion. Her perceptions at once encapsulate one of the core themes of her novel and answer some of her more urbane critics. \"Brooklyn is the small town &#151; but on a gigantic scale &#151; that the New Yorker ran away from,\" she wrote. \"In jeering at Brooklyn's mores and ideology, your New Yorker may be trying to exorcise his own small-town background.\"Although most remembered for the phenomenal success of that first book, Smith wrote other novels, including <I>Tomorrow Will Be Better</I> (1947), <I>Maggie-Now</I> (1958), and <I>Joy in the Morning</I> (1963). She also had a long career as a dramatist, writing one-act and full-length plays for which she received both the Rockefeller Fellowship and the Dramatists Guild Fellowship.

Often people's lives reflect the weather and <em>The Hurricane Sisters</em> is just such a story.</p><p>Once again <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author&#160;Dorothea Benton Frank takes us deep into the heart of her magical South Carolina Lowcountry on a tumultuous journey filled with longings, disappointments, and, finally, a road toward happiness that is hard earned. There we meet three generations of women buried in secrets. The determined matriarch, Maisie Pringle, at eighty, is a force to be reckoned with because she will have the final word on everything, especially when she's dead wrong. Her daughter, Liz, is caught up in the classic maelstrom of being middle-age and in an emotionally demanding career that will eventually open all their eyes to a terrible truth. And Liz's beautiful twenty-something daughter, Ashley, whose dreamy ambitions of her unlikely future keeps them all at odds.</p><p>Luckily for Ashley, her wonderful older brother, Ivy, is her fierce champion but he can only do so much from San Francisco where he resides with his partner. And Mary Beth, her dearest friend, tries to have her back but even she can't talk headstrong Ashley out of a relationship with an ambitious politician who seems slightly too old for her.</p><p>Actually, Ashley and Mary Beth have yet to launch themselves into solvency. Their prospects seem bleak. So while they wait for the world to discover them and deliver them from a ramen-based existence, they placate themselves with a hare-brained scheme to make money but one that threatens to land them in huge trouble with the authorities.</p><p>So where is Clayton, Liz's husband? He seems more distracted than usual. Ashley desperately needs her father's love and attention but what kind of a parent can he be to Ashley with one foot in Manhattan and the other one planted in indiscretion? And Liz, who's an expert in the field of troubled domestic life, refuses to acknowledge Ashley's precarious situation. Who's in charge of this family? The wake-up call is about to arrive.</p><p>The Lowcountry has endured its share of war and bloodshed like the rest of the South, but this storm season we watch Maisie, Liz, Ashley, and Mary Beth deal with challenges that demand they face the truth about themselves. After a terrible confrontation they are forced to rise to forgiveness, but can they establish a new order for the future of them all?</p><p>Frank, with her hallmark scintillating wit and crisp insight, captures how a complex family of disparate characters and their close friends can overcome anything through the power of love and reconciliation. This is the often hilarious, sometimes sobering, but always entertaining story of how these unforgettable women became <em>The Hurricane Sisters</em>.</p>","Price":11.99,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":379,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmQ4o6D82sEZucVEN7nXvKD45hVoyimLZLLLKCvTHULGqi","PictureSmallUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/Qmf4M5k6kmxqeM4FJki4ajwTaiwpkFHPRjaSqafBjoeBRH","PictureMediumUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmQ4o6D82sEZucVEN7nXvKD45hVoyimLZLLLKCvTHULGqi","PictureLargeUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmVaQmji1kte2bf5TBa1Q1bpajmqRnQ9QvA8kqVBgHfUoL","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"Jun 03, 2014\",\"Author\":\"Dorothea Benton Frank\",\"Publisher\":\"William Morrow\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"451\",\"Subject Time\":\"\",\"Subject\":\"\",\"Age Min\":\"\",\"Age Max\":\"\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"FIC044000\"}","Rank":805,"Height":0,"Width":0,"Depth":0,"Weight":0,"Id":805},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780525579649","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"All are welcome","Description":"<P><b>Celebrate diversity and inclusion with this <i>New York Times</i> bestselling picture book about a school where all are welcome!&#160;Look under the jacket for a poster, and don't miss the fold-out page at the end of the book.</b><br><br>Follow a group of children through a day in their school, where everyone is welcomed with open arms.

With no mercy and seemingly no motive, the Manson Family followed their leader's every order-their crimes lit a flame of paranoia across the nation, spelling the end of the sixties. Manson became one of history's most infamous criminals, his name forever attached to an era when charlatans mixed with prodigies, free love was as possible as brainwashing, and utopia-or dystopia-was just an acid trip away. <br><br>Twenty years ago, when journalist Tom O'Neill was reporting a magazine piece about the murders, he worried there was nothing new to say. Then he unearthed shocking evidence of a cover-up behind the \"official\" story, including police carelessness, legal misconduct, and potential surveillance by intelligence agents. When a tense interview with Vincent Bugliosi-prosecutor of the Manson Family, and author of <i>Helter Skelter</i>-turned a friendly source into a nemesis, O'Neill knew he was onto something. But every discovery brought more questions&#58;<br> <ul> <li>Who were Manson's real friends in Hollywood, and how far would they go to hide their ties? <li>Why didn't law enforcement, including Manson's own parole officer, act on their many chances to stop him? <li>And how did Manson-an illiterate ex-con-turn a group of peaceful hippies into remorseless killers?</li></ul><br>O'Neill's quest for the truth led him from reclusive celebrities to seasoned spies, from San Francisco's summer of love to the shadowy sites of the CIA's mind-control experiments, on a trail rife with shady cover-ups and suspicious coincidences. The product of two decades of reporting, hundreds of new interviews, and dozens of never-before-seen documents from the LAPD, the FBI, and the CIA, CHAOS mounts an argument that could be, according to Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Steven Kay, strong enough to overturn the verdicts on the Manson murders.

Grant.</b><br> &#160;<br> Ulysses S. Grant's life has typically been misunderstood. All too often he is caricatured as a chronic loser and an inept businessman, or as the triumphant but brutal Union general of the Civil War. But these stereotypes don't come close to capturing him, as Chernow shows in his masterful biography, the first to provide a complete understanding of the general and president whose fortunes rose and fell with dizzying speed and frequency.<br> &#160;<br> Before the Civil War, Grant was flailing. His business ventures had ended dismally, and despite distinguished service in the Mexican War he ended up resigning from the army in disgrace amid recurring accusations of drunkenness. But in war, Grant began to realize his remarkable potential, soaring through the ranks of the Union army, prevailing at the battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign, and ultimately defeating the legendary Confederate general Robert E. Lee. Along the way, Grant endeared himself to President Lincoln and became his most trusted general and the strategic genius of the war effort. Grant&rsquo;s military fame translated into a two-term presidency, but one plagued by corruption scandals involving his closest staff members.<br><br> More important, he sought freedom and justice for black Americans, working to crush the Ku Klux Klan and earning the admiration of Frederick Douglass, who called him &ldquo;the vigilant, firm, impartial, and wise protector of my race.&rdquo; After his presidency, he was again brought low by a dashing young swindler on Wall Street, only to resuscitate his image by working with Mark Twain to publish his memoirs, which are recognized as a masterpiece of the genre. <br> &#160;<br> With lucidity, breadth, and meticulousness, Chernow finds the threads that bind these disparate stories together, shedding new light on the man whom Walt Whitman described as &ldquo;nothing heroic... and yet the greatest hero.&rdquo; Chernow&rsquo;s probing portrait of Grant's lifelong struggle with alcoholism transforms our understanding of the man at the deepest level. This is America's greatest biographer, bringing movingly to life one of our finest but most underappreciated presidents. The definitive biography, <i>Grant</i> is a grand synthesis of painstaking research and literary brilliance that makes sense of all sides of Grant's life, explaining how this simple Midwesterner could at once be so ordinary and so extraordinary.<br><br><b>Named one of the best books of the year by Goodreads &bull;<i> </i>Amazon <i>&bull; The New York Times</i> <i>&bull; Newsday</i> <i>&bull; </i>BookPage <i>&bull; </i>Barnes and Noble <i>&bull; Wall Street Journal</i> </b>","Price":22.0,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":75,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"","PictureSmallUri":"","PictureMediumUri":"","PictureLargeUri":"","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"\",\"Author\":\"Ron Chernow\",\"Publisher\":\"Penguin Books\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"\",\"Subject Time\":\"Civil War Period (1850-1877)\",\"Subject\":\"slaves\",\"Age Min\":\"\",\"Age Max\":\"\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"BIO011000\"}","Rank":907,"Height":233,"Width":152,"Depth":59,"Weight":0,"Id":907},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780316360647","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"Fruits basket","Description":"<P>Spring is in the air, and with spring comes break!

Janie&#39;s quest for identity takes her through three marriages and into a journey back to her roots.<P>Author Biography&#58;  In her award-winning autobiography, <I>Dust Trackson a Road</I> (1942), Zora Neale Hurston claimed to have been born inEatonville, Florida, in 1901. She was, in fact, born in Notasulga, Alabama, onJanuary 7, 1891, the fifth child of John Hurston (farmer, carpenter, and Baptistpreacher) and Lucy Ann Potts (school teacher). The author of numerous books,including <I>Their Eyes Were Watching God,</I> <I>Jonah's Gourd Vine,</I> <I>Mulesand Men,</I> and <I>Moses, Man of the Mountain,</I> Hurston had achieved fameand sparked controversy as a novelist, anthropologist, outspoken essayist,lecturer, and theatrical producer during her sixty-nine years. Hurston's finestwork of fiction appeared at a time when artistic and politicalstatements&#151;whether single sentences or book-length fictions&#151;were peculiarlyconflated. Many works of fiction were informed by purely political motives;political pronouncements frequently appeared in polished literary prose. AndHurston's own political statements, relating to racial issues or addressingnational politics, did not ingratiate her with her black male contemporaries.The end result was that <I>Their Eyes Were Watching God</I> went out of printnot long after its first appearance and remained out of print for nearly thirtyyears.

These simple methods represent a new era in sexual intimacy, one in which the exchange of pleasure occurs on a level playing field and fulfillment is mutual. <P><I>She Comes First</I> exuberantly offers a fresh new sexual philosophy that inspires every man to make a mantra of Rhett Butler's infamous  line to Scarlett O'Hara, \"You should be kissed, and often, and by someone who knows how.\"","Price":16.99,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":516,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmRFT4SAh2UZgbnTk1BHqwhyUToXKgXze9Dn2yMFxPQ8of","PictureSmallUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmZjghoJbgVEmHKK4tJU1ZdfybNoL8uKbxEunLvqyMY6Se","PictureMediumUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmRFT4SAh2UZgbnTk1BHqwhyUToXKgXze9Dn2yMFxPQ8of","PictureLargeUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmSYMRXopLo2kM3Q1zYv6yEd7zN5erq48dvRcFRuSUwwvH","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"January 29, 2008\",\"Author\":\"Ian Kerner\",\"Publisher\":\"Collins\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"240\",\"Subject Time\":\"\",\"Subject\":\"Sex instruction for men\",\"Age Min\":\"\",\"Age Max\":\"\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"613.960\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"HEA042000\"}","Rank":954,"Height":209,"Width":139,"Depth":15,"Weight":0,"Id":954},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780374268091","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"Still Here: The Madcap, Nervy, Singular Life of Elaine Stritch","Description":"<P><b>Named a favorite nonfiction book of 2019 by <i>The New Yorker</i></b><p><p><b>\"Compulsively readable . . . ravenously consuming . . . manna from heaven . . .

But no one, not even Katherine herself, could have anticipated that she would fall in love with and secretly marry one of her guardians, Owen Tudor&#8212;or that a generation later, their grandson would become the first king of the great Tudor dynasty.<br><br><br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>","Price":11.99,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":530,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"","PictureSmallUri":"","PictureMediumUri":"","PictureLargeUri":"","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"2010\",\"Author\":\"Victoria Holt\",\"Publisher\":\"Crown Publishing Group\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"\",\"Subject Time\":\"Henry V, 1413-1422\",\"Subject\":\"Fiction\",\"Age Min\":\"\",\"Age Max\":\"\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"FIC014000\"}","Rank":991,"Height":0,"Width":0,"Depth":0,"Weight":0,"Id":991},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780062072184","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"Portrait of a spy","Description":"<p>\"Suspense writing at its best.\"&#8212;<em>HUFFINGTON POST</em></p><p>It was supposed to be the start of a pleasant weekend in London for master art restorer and spy Gabriel Allon and his wife, Chiara.

Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents&rsquo; indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa&rsquo;s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.<br><br> <i>Born a Crime</i> is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man&rsquo;s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother&mdash;his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.<br><br> The stories collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother&rsquo;s unconventional, unconditional love.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Born a Crime</i></b><br><br>&#160;&ldquo;[A] compelling new memoir . . .

It is by turns amusing and alarming.\"<b> <i>-- The New Yorker</i></b><br><b><i><br></i></b><br>\"Golf is the spine of this shocking, wildly humorous book, but humanity is its flesh and spirit.\" <b><i>-- Chicago Sun-Times</i></b><br><br><b><i><br></i></b><br>\"Every one of Trump's most disgusting qualities surfaces in golf.\" <b><i>-- The Ringer</i></b><br><br><b><br></b><br><b>An outrageous indictment of Donald Trump's appalling behavior when it comes to golf -- on and off the green -- and what it reveals about his character. </b><br> <br>Donald Trump loves golf. He loves to play it, buy it, build it, and operate it. He owns 14 courses around the world and runs another five, all of which he insists are the best on the planet. He also claims he's a 3 handicap, almost never loses, and has won an astonishing 18 club championships. <br><br><br><br>How much of all that is true? Almost none of it, acclaimed sportswriter Rick Reilly reveals in this unsparing look at Trump in the world of golf. <br><br><br>Based on Reilly's own experiences with Trump as well as interviews with over 100 golf pros, amateurs, developers, and caddies, <i>Commander in Cheat </i>is a startling and at times hilarious indictment of Trump and his golf game. You'll learn how Trump cheats (sometimes with the help of his caddies and Secret Service agents), lies about his scores (the \"Trump Bump\"), tells whoppers about the rank of his courses and their worth (declaring that every one of them is worth $50 million), and tramples the etiquette of the game (driving on greens doesn't help). Trump doesn't brag so much, though, about the golf contractors he stiffs, the course neighbors he intimidates, or the way his golf decisions wind up infecting his political ones. <br><br><br><br>For Trump, it's always about winning.

Since the early days of interstellar travel, when Tuxedo Thomas, a Maine coon cat, showed what a cat could do for a ship and its crew, the so-called Barque Cats have become highly prized crew members. Thomas's carefully bred progeny, ably assisted by humans&mdash;Cat Persons&mdash;with whom they share a deep and loving bond, now travel the galaxy, responsible for keeping spacecraft free of vermin, for alerting human crews to potential environmental hazards, and for acting as morale officers.<br><br>Even among Barque Cats, Chessie is something special.

Chessie is kidnapped&mdash;er, catnapped&mdash;from Dr. Jared Vlast's vet clinic at Hood Station by a grizzled spacer named Carl Poindexter.

For while Chessie's connection to Janina is close and intuitive, the bond that the kitten Chester forms with Carl's son, Jubal, is downright telepathic.

Why do people so readily assume the worst about the motives of their fellow citizens? In <i>The Righteous Mind, </i>social psychologist Jonathan Haidt explores the origins of our divisions and points the way forward to mutual understanding. <br>&#160;<br>His starting point is moral intuition&mdash;the nearly instantaneous perceptions we all have about other people and the things they do. These intuitions feel like self-evident truths, making us righteously certain that those who see things differently are wrong. Haidt shows us how these intuitions differ across cultures, including the cultures of the political left and right. He blends his own research findings with those of anthropologists, historians, and other psychologists to draw a map of the moral domain, and he explains why conservatives can navigate that map more skillfully than can liberals. He then examines the origins of morality, overturning the view that evolution made us fundamentally selfish creatures. But rather than arguing that we are innately altruistic, he makes a more subtle claim&mdash;that we are fundamentally <i>groupish. </i>It is our groupishness, he explains, that leads to our greatest joys, our religious divisions, and our political affiliations. In a stunning final chapter on ideology and civility, Haidt shows what each side is right about, and why we need the insights of liberals, conservatives, and libertarians to flourish as a nation.</p>","Price":17.0,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":559,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmXrEQ5MGyGKmsVAKM9HZ9jaQ2pQNPTW4JBRWQbFeq5Uka","PictureSmallUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/Qmc2u7ncH94F7a4RpoLevW3bg6PZz6kHngFt7WMj6Ey6Tw","PictureMediumUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmXrEQ5MGyGKmsVAKM9HZ9jaQ2pQNPTW4JBRWQbFeq5Uka","PictureLargeUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmcBVUZrX8YecPqY7q6EdpHmpkZx8BnZrpa6Vy41r83S4X","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"2013\",\"Author\":\"Jonathan Haidt\",\"Publisher\":\"Vintage Books\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"\",\"Subject Time\":\"\",\"Subject\":\"\",\"Age Min\":\"\",\"Age Max\":\"\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"201/.61\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"PSY031000\"}","Rank":1069,"Height":201,"Width":130,"Depth":26,"Weight":0,"Id":1069},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780062473448","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"This Time Will Be Different","Description":"<P><b>A <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> Best Book</b></p><P><b>For fans of Jenny Han, Morgan Matson, and Sandhya Menon, critically acclaimed author Misa Sugiura<i> </i>delivers a richly crafted contemporary YA novel about family, community, and the importance of writing your own history.</b></br></p><P>The author of the Asian Pacific American Award-winning <i>It&#8217;s Not Like It&#8217;s a Secret </i>is back with another smartly drawn coming-of-age novel that weaves riveting family drama, surprising humor, and delightful romance into a story that will draw you in from the very first page.</p><P>Katsuyamas never quit&#8212;but seventeen-year-old CJ doesn&#8217;t even know where to start.

But over the past four years, the Oakland Athletics, a major league team with a minor league payroll, have had one of the best records. Last year their superstar, Jason Giambi, went to the superrich Yankees. It hasn't made any difference to Oakland: their fabulous season included an American League record for consecutive victories. Billy Beane, general manager of the Athletics, is putting into practice on the field revolutionary principles garnered from geek statisticians and college professors. Michael Lewis's brilliant, irreverent reporting takes us from the dugouts and locker rooms-where coaches and players struggle to unlearn most of what they know about pitching and hitting-to the boardrooms, where we meet owners who begin to look like fools at the poker table, spending enormous sums without a clue what they are doing. Combine money, science, entertainment, and egos, and you have a story that Michael Lewis is magnificently suited to tell. <p><b>About the Author</b><p>Author of the bestsellers Liar's Poker, The New New Thing, and Next, Michael Lewis is also a columnist for Bloomberg News.

First there were her acclaimed Victorian mysteries, sparkling with passion and suspense. Now readers have embraced this bestselling new series of World War I novels&#8211;which juxtapose the tranquil life of the English countryside with the horrors of war.<br><br>By April of 1915, as chaplain Joseph Reavley tends to the soldiers in his care, the nightmare of trench warfare is impartially cutting down England&#8217;s youth. On one of his rescue forays into no-man&#8217;s-land, Joseph finds the body of an arrogant war correspondent, Eldon Prentice. A nephew of the respected General Owen Cullingford, Prentice was despised for his prying attempts to elicit facts that would turn public opinion against the war. Most troublesome to Joseph, Prentice has been killed not by German fire but, apparently, by one of his own compatriots. What Englishman hated Prentice enough to kill him? Joseph is afraid he may know, and his sister, Judith, who is General Cullingford&#8217;s driver and translator, harbors her own fearful suspicions.<br><br>Meanwhile, Joseph and Judith&#8217;s brother, Matthew, an intelligence officer in London, continues his quiet search for the sinister figure they call the Peacemaker, who, like Eldon Prentice, is trying to undermine the public support for the struggle&#8211;and, as the Reavley family has good reason to believe, is in fact at the heart of a fantastic plot to reshape the entire world. An intimate of kings, the Peacemaker kills with impunity, and his dark shadow stretches from the peaceful country lanes of Cambridgeshire to the twin hells of Ypres and Gallipoli.<br><br>In this mesmerizing series, Anne Perry has found a subject worthy of her gifts.

Brooks blends cutting-edge behavioral research, ancient wisdom, and a decade of experience of experience leading one of America&#8217;s top policy think tanks in a work that&#160;offers a better way to lead based&#160;on bridging divides and mending relationships.</p><p>Brooks&#8217; prescriptions are unconventional. To bring America together, we shouldn&#8217;t try to agree more. There is no need for mushy moderation, because disagreement is the secret to excellence. Civility and tolerance shouldn&#8217;t be our goals, because they are hopelessly low standards. And our feelings toward our foes are irrelevant; what matters is how we choose to act.</p><p><em>Love Your Enemies</em> offers a clear strategy for victory for a new generation of leaders. It is a rallying cry for people hoping for a new era of American progress. Most of all, it is a roadmap to arrive at the happiness that comes when we choose to love one another, despite our differences.</p><p>&#160;</p>","Price":27.99,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":594,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmT7CGPRKjQNKAwCe38UUNtMvpnYynNarjjjVci9mqA5AU","PictureSmallUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmV2cm3XSg8tdgsoLNfKHdcwXStupRDdjUrcJCbH7Mmthu","PictureMediumUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmT7CGPRKjQNKAwCe38UUNtMvpnYynNarjjjVci9mqA5AU","PictureLargeUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmP8PncGnTY1nxmbaxMCvbGBRz6prhMb892wysPVmkGbwo","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"Mar 12, 2019\",\"Author\":\"Arthur C.

The gorgeous exec has become entangled in some potentially deadly business. Someone has e-mailed her a graphic crime-scene photo&#8211;and the victim is no stranger.<br><br>Regan suspects that the trouble started when she agreed to help a journalist friend expose a shady self-help guru who preys on lonely, vulnerable women. In fact, the smooth-as-an-oil-slick Dr. Lawrence Shields may be responsible for the death of one of his devotees, which was ruled a suicide. Hoping to find some damning evidence, Regan attends a Shields seminar.<br><br>At the gathering, the doctor persuades his guests to partake in an innocent little &#8220;cleansing&#8221; exercise. He asks them to make a list of the people who have hurt or deceived them over the years, posing the question&#58; <i>Would your world be a better place if these people ceased to exist?</i> Treating the exercise as a game, Regan plays along. After ten minutes, Shields instructs the participants to bring their sheets of paper to the fireplace and throw them into the flames. But Regan misses this part of the program when she exits the room to take a call&#8211;and barely escapes a menacing individual in the parking lot.<br><br>The experience is all but forgotten&#8211;until the first person on Regan&#8217;s list turns up dead. Shock turns to horror when other bodies from the list start to surface, as a harrowing tango of desire and death is set into motion. Now brutal murders seem to stalk her every move&#8211;and a growing attraction to Alec may compromise her safety, while stirring up tender emotions she thought she could no longer feel. Yet as the danger intensifies and a serial killer circles ever closer, Regan must discover who has turned her private revenge fantasies into grisly reality.","Price":5.99,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":174,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmVyDMVPLHmMSwcmAMxqhCNvaFN8CKn1wLkiyaFeWVea9f","PictureSmallUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/Qmack4pPsRX4mb8znuUDdgwFsLpfqBZYD2VJG9vyfdRVmP","PictureMediumUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmVyDMVPLHmMSwcmAMxqhCNvaFN8CKn1wLkiyaFeWVea9f","PictureLargeUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmXrk6KG99V9uSUhKJ3ikVtmCWpBXFNEGkSZ1PWAkqW9kz","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"2004\",\"Author\":\"Julie Garwood\",\"Publisher\":\"Random House Publishing Group\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"\",\"Subject Time\":\"\",\"Subject\":\"Cult members\",\"Age Min\":\"\",\"Age Max\":\"\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"FIC030000\"}","Rank":1178,"Height":0,"Width":0,"Depth":0,"Weight":0,"Id":1178},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780142406113","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"Stormbreaker (Alex Rider Adventure)","Description":" They told him his uncle died in a car accident.

But when Noah Clayborne, a close family friend and a man who has never let a good time or a pretty girl pass him by, accuses Jordan of being trapped in her comfort zone, she determines to prove him wrong and sets out on a spontaneous adventure to the small, dusty town of Serenity, Texas, to judge the professor&#8217;s research for herself.<br><br>Maneuvering through a close-knit community in which everyone knows everyone else&#8217;s business, Jordan never anticipates the danger and intrigue that lie in her path, nor the threat that will shadow her back to Boston, where even in familiar surroundings, her life is at risk.<br><br>A powerful thug who rules by fear, a man who harbors a simmering secret, and an unexpected romance that pierces all defenses&#8211;beloved author Julie Garwood weaves these dazzling elements into a brilliant novel of romantic suspense. Shadow Dance is a searing tango of passion and peril.","Price":6.99,"Unit":null,"CatalogTypeId":1,"CatalogType":null,"CatalogBrandId":174,"CatalogBrand":null,"PictureUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmRdGKdzgAPd7h3dJbgVG88JGBc7rVu4JzKWwX39ZLoRjK","PictureSmallUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmdMHbSYJ18MvV5cJjc4PmrXGFG233Bpx3WraPkp1Yycro","PictureMediumUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmRdGKdzgAPd7h3dJbgVG88JGBc7rVu4JzKWwX39ZLoRjK","PictureLargeUri":"https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmZ5a5KvjX1YhxmWqbZwGauFW499ZCqyNmJChFr26WM8Vt","AttributeJson":"{\"Publication Date\":\"2006\",\"Author\":\"Julie Garwood\",\"Publisher\":\"Random House Publishing Group\",\"Number Of Pages\":\"\",\"Subject Time\":\"\",\"Subject\":\"Irish Americans\",\"Age Min\":\"\",\"Age Max\":\"\",\"Adult Only\":\"\",\"DEWEW_NUM Date\":\"\",\"Public Domain\":\"\",\"Publication Country\":\"\",\"US_RIGHTS_IND\":\"N\",\"BISAC_SUBJ_CD\":\"FIC027110\"}","Rank":1214,"Height":0,"Width":0,"Depth":0,"Weight":0,"Id":1214},{"Status":0,"Gtin":"9780064408677","GtinRegistryId":null,"Name":"The Trumpet of the Swan","Description":"Louis is a Trumpeter Swan who came into the world lacking a voice.

He writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the birth of the Lost Cause; the backlash against immigrants in the First World War and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s; the fight for women&rsquo;s rights; the demagoguery of Huey Long and Father Coughlin and the isolationist work of America First in the years before World War II; the anti-Communist witch-hunts led by Senator Joseph McCarthy; and Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s crusade against Jim Crow.
